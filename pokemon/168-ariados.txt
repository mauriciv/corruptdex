Ariados is a Pok√©mon that resembles a spider.
It has a red body with black stripes and markings on is rear that form a face.
In the center of its head in small, white horn.
Additionally, it also has small purple eyes and a pair of white mandibles.
Ariados has four yellow legs with purple stripes; long, pointed growths on its back appear to be remnants of its fifth and sixth legs.
Ariados's feet are tipped with tiny hooked claws that enable it to scuttle on ceilings and vertical walls.
It spins a single strand of a special string endlessly out of its rear.
The string can also be spun from its mouth; however, it is hard to tell which end is which.
Rather than making a nest in one specific spot, it wanders in search of food after darkness falls.
It will attach silk to its prey and set it free.
Later, it tracks the silk to the prey and its friends.
Ariados makes its nest in the depths of the forest.

There are some areas where people use the string Ariados spins for their own weaving.
The resulting cloth is popular for its strength.
It spins thread from both its rear and its mouth.
Then it wraps its prey up in thread and sips their bodily fluids at its leisure.
Every night, it wanders around in search of prey, whose movements it restrains by spewing threads before it bites into them with its fangs.
It spews threads from its mouth to catch its prey.
When night falls, it leaves its web to go hunt aggressively.
