Ivysaur is a quadruped Pok√©mon similar to a dinosaur.
It has blue-green skin with darker patches.
On top of its head are pointed ears with black insides, and it has narrow red eyes.
It has a short, rounded snout with a wide mouth.
Two pointed teeth protrude from its upper jaw.
Each of its feet have three claws on them.
The bulb on its back has bloomed into a large pink bud.
A short brown trunk surrounded by leafy green fronds supports the bud.
The weight of the plant prevents Ivysaur from standing on its hind legs and forces its legs to grow sturdy.
When its flower is ready to bloom, it gives off a distinct, strong sweet-smelling aroma and starts swelling.
Ivysaur will also start spending more time in sunlight in preparation for its upcoming evolution.
Exposure to sunlight adds to the strength of both Ivysaur and its plant.
Ivysaur's natural habitat is plains.

There is a plant bulb on its back. When it absorbs nutrients, the bulb is said to blossom into a large flower.
When the bud on its back starts swelling, a sweet aroma wafts to indicate the flower's coming bloom.
