Ekans is a purple, serpentine Pokémon.
Its eyes, underbelly, the thick stripe around its neck, and rattle are yellow.
Ekans has three pairs of black lines encircling its body, as well as another line that connects each slitted eye and curves toward its nose.
Its large mouth has a round, pink tongue and no visible teeth.
While painful, a newborn Ekans's bite is not venomous.
This Pokémon grows longer with age.

Ekans lives in grassy savannas and plains, where it moves stealthily through grass.
It preys on Eggs from Pidgey and Spearow nests, but can strike other prey from behind.
By flicking its tongue out, it is able to detect danger and the scent of prey.
Its jaw can detach to swallow large prey, but such a meal can make Ekans too heavy to move.
It wraps itself around tree branches at night to rest.
If not in a tree, it will coil itself up—a position in which it can defend itself from all directions.
It was also shown in the second movie to possess some swimming abilities.
Its former signature move is Glare.

The older it gets, the longer it grows. At night, it wraps its long body around tree branches to rest.
Moving silently and stealthily, it eats the eggs of birds, such as Pidgey and Spearow, whole.
