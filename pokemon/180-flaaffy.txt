Flaaffy is a pink, bipedal, sheep-like Pok√©mon.
It has thick, conical ears with black stripes on the sides of its head and small, blue eyes.
A white mane of wool covers its head and upper body.
This mane forms sideways curls on the top of its head.
It has stubby arms and one nail on each foot.
Flaaffy's long tail has black stripes and is tipped with a blue orb.

Storing too much electricity caused Flaaffy to lose the wool over most of its body, but the bare, rubbery skin protects it from the electricity stored in its fleece.
The quality of Flaaffy's fleece can change to generate more electricity with less wool.
The orb will light up when Flaaffy's mane is fully charged, and it can attack by firing electrified hairs at opponents.
Flaaffy typically inhabits grassy meadows and fields.

Its fluffy fleece easily stores electricity.
Its rubbery hide keeps it from being electrocuted.
If its coat becomes fully charged with electricity, its tail lights up.
It fires hair that zaps on impact.
Flaaffy's wool quality changes so that it can generate a high amount of static electricity with a small amount of wool.
The bare and slick parts of its hide are shielded against electricity.

In the places on its body where fleece doesn't grow, its skin is rubbery and doesn't conduct electricity.
Those spots are safe to touch.
It stores electricity in its fluffy fleece.
If it stores up too much, it will start to go bald in those patches.
