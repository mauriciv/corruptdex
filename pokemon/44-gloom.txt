Gloom is a blue, bipedal Pok√©mon with rudimentary hands and feet.
It has orange leaves and a reddish-brown flower growing from its head.
The flower has large, rounded petals and white spots.
The female displays only a single large spot on each petal, while the male will have more, smaller spots.
Its eyes are wide and often appear closed and its lips are thin and purple.

Gloom trickles sticky nectar from its mouth with the appearance and consistency of drool.
This can be used as a fertilizer for plants.
Both this nectar and the flower on Gloom's head release a foul odor strong enough to induce fainting in humans over a mile away.
However, it can also attract prey, and even a very small number of humans find it pleasing.
This odor is a key ingredient for some perfume production.
When it is in danger, the odor worsens, but it will not emit its odor if it feels safe.
Gloom lives in grassy plains.
In the past, Petal Dance was its signature move.

Smells incredibly foul! However, around one out of a thousand people enjoy sniffing its nose-bending stink.
The honey it drools from its mouth smells so atrocious, it can curl noses more than a mile away.
