Magcargo is a limbless, snail-like Pokémon consisting almost entirely of bright red magma.
Its oval eyes are large and yellow with small pupils, and extend upward from its head.
It has a bulbous snout and a wide mouth, with two drops of magma dangling from each side of its upper jaw.
Magcargo's back is protected by a gray, spherical shell composed of hardened, but brittle magma, forming irregular lumps and plates.
A streak of fire leaks from the side of its shell.
Magcargo's lower body is amorphous and covered in bubbles of magma.

Magcargo's internal body temperature can reach over 18,000 °F (10,000 °C), causing it to evaporate water on contact.
Flames circulate throughout its body, occasionally spouting through cracks in its shell.
While its shell is brittle enough to be shattered with a slight touch, Magcargo can reform its body by dipping itself in magma.
It can be found in mountainous regions, and has been living in volcano craters for tens of thousands of years.

Its brittle shell occasionally spouts intense flames that circulate throughout its body.
Its body is as hot as lava and is always billowing.
Flames will occasionally burst from its shell.
Magcargo's shell is actually its skin that hardened as a result of cooling.
Its shell is very brittle and fragile - just touching it causes it to crumble apart.
This Pokémon returns to its original size by dipping itself in magma.
Magcargo's body temperature is approximately 18,000 degrees Fahrenheit.
Water is vaporized on contact.
If this Pokémon is caught in the rain, the raindrops instantly turn into steam, cloaking the area in a thick fog.
