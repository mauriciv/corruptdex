Zubat is a blue, bat-like Pok√©mon.
While it lacks eyes, it has pointed ears with purple insides and a mouth with two sharp teeth on each jaw.
A male will have larger fangs than the female.
It has purple wing membranes support by two, elongated fingers, and two long, thin, tails.

Zubat lives in abundance in caves.
It has evolved to have neither eyes nor nostrils, instead navigating through dark environments with echolocation.
As demonstrated in the anime, it will leave its abode at night with a mass of other Zubat in order to seek prey.
During the daytime, Zubat sleeps hanging upside down in caves, forests, or under the eaves of old buildings, avoiding sunlight at all costs.
Daylight causes Zubat to become unhealthy, and prolonged exposure can even burn its skin.
However, captured and trained Zubat have been recorded as being much more tenacious in the daytime, even when directly exposed to sunbeams.

It sleeps in caves during the day.
It has no eyes, so to check its surroundings while flying, it emits ultrasonic waves.
When exposed to sunlight, they suffer burns.
The frequency of their ultrasonic waves can differ slightly from colony to colony.
