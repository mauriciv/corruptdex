Forretress is a large, spherical Pokémon with no visible limbs.
The upper and lower halves of its body are capped by bumpy steel plates.
The outer plates have zigzagging ridges that open along its back and front, revealing its smooth, red inner shell.
The inner shell is punctuated by four cylindrical spikes, each tapering to an open point.
Between the spikes, the inner shell opens along a straight line to reveal Forretress's eyes, which are round with large pupils.
Whatever else lies inside its shell is unknown.

Forretress can defend itself from enemies by shooting out pieces of its outer shell, as a conditioned reflex rather than a conscious effort.
It opens its shell to capture prey, but does so quickly that its interior body cannot be seen.
It lives in forests, attaching itself immovably to tree trunks.

It is encased in a steel shell.
Its peering eyes are all that can be seen of its mysterious innards.
It remains immovably rooted to its tree.
It scatters pieces of its hard shell to drive its enemies away.
Forretress conceals itself inside its hardened steel shell.
The shell is opened when the Pokémon is catching prey, but it does so at such a quick pace that the shell's inside cannot be seen.


When something approaches it, it fires off fragments of its steel shell in attack.
This is not a conscious action but a conditioned reflex.
In the moment that it gulps down its prey, the inside of its shell is exposed, but to this day, no one has ever seen that sight.
