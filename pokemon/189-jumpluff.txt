Jumpluff is a round, blue Pokémon with red beady eyes and small, round feet and tail.
Three cotton puffs, almost as large as the body itself, extend off it: one on each arm, and one on top of its head.
These puffs produce cotton spores that it can use to float in the air, and it can control its flight even in a hurricane.
Three to four leaves grow at the base of the top puff.

Jumpluff drifts on seasonal winds and can use its spores to masterfully maneuver itself around the globe.
It will spread spores as it floats around to create offspring.
It descends if it encounters cold air currents while it is floating.
Though it spends a good amount of time in the air, it is commonly sighted above open grasslands.

Blown by seasonal winds, it circles the globe, scattering cotton spores as it goes.
Even in the fiercest wind, it can control its fluff to make its way to any place in the world it wants.
Jumpluff rides warm southern winds to cross the sea and fly to foreign lands.
The Pokémon descends to the ground when it encounters cold air while it is floating.
