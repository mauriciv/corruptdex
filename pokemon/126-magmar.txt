Magmar is a bipedal Pokémon with a red body that has yellow flame designs on it.
A row of red spikes runs down its back, and there are two lumps on its forehead with a flame on top of each one.

Its arms are covered in rigid, red scales and it has red hands with five, clawed fingers.
It has black, metal shackles on its neck and ankles.
At the tips of its yellow tail is a flame.

Magmar's body temperature is nearly 2,200 °F (1,200 °C).
The anime has shown that extremely well trained Magmar can have the ability to block Electric-type attacks with super-heated air.
Because it hates cold places, this Pokémon typically resides in and around active volcanoes.
This Pokémon has even been known to alter unfavorably cold surroundings by spitting scorching flames about to warm up the area and establish an environment more suitable to it.

Magmar is able to heal its wounds by dipping its wound into lava.
In battle, it blows out intense flames from all over its body as to intimidate its foes and incinerate its surroundings.
However, an outmatched Magmar will quickly retreat, using its fiery camouflage and its wavering, rippling glare to blend into any present fires.
When it's tired, it leaps into the mouth of a volcano and soaks its body in magma to ease its weariness.
Its body burns at 2,192 degrees F.
When angered, it spouts brilliant fire from all over its body.
It doesn't calm down until its opponent has burned to ash.
Its entire body is burning.
When it breathes, the temperature rises.
When it sneezes, flames shoot out.
The hotter the place, the better they feel.
Magmar in Alola are said to be hardier than those in other areas.
