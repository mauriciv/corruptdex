Qwilfish is a sea dwelling Pokémon with a spherical body and a flat, paddle-shaped tail.
The upper half of its body is dark teal and the lower half is very light yellow.
Its tail is tall and thin with a dark teal outline, light yellow inside, and two dark teal dots in the center.
Its eyes are even with its body, and are always seen slanted angrily.
Below its eyes are its puffy pink lips.
All around its body are sharp, conical spikes, which evolved from scales over time.
In order to attack, Qwilfish drinks over 10 litres of water to inflate its body.
It then uses the water pressure to shoot poisonous quills at its foe, which can cause fainting.
Due to its round body, Qwilfish is not a great swimmer, and when filled with water it is even harder for it to swim.

To fire its poison spikes, it must inflate its body by drinking over 10 litres of water at once.
The small spikes covering its body developed from scales.
They inject a toxin that causes fainting.
Qwilfish sucks in water, inflating itself.
This Pokémon uses the pressure of the water it swallowed to shoot toxic quills all at once from all over its body.
It finds swimming somewhat challenging.
