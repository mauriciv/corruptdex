Ursaring is a bipedal, ursine Pokémon.
Its broad body is covered in brown fur, except its muzzle, inner ears, and paw pads, which are a light tan.
It has narrow eyes, a triangular, black nose, and wide mouth with small, visible fangs in the upper jaw.
The fur on Ursaring’s shoulders is longer and more structured, with rectangular extensions that resemble epaulettes.
A female Ursaring has longer fur on its shoulders than a male.
There is a large, tan, ring-shaped mark on its chest.
Ursaring's forelimbs are long, ending in five claws each, while its hind legs are short and thick, ending in three claws each.
Its tail is large and spherical in shape.

Ursaring lives in mountainous forests, sleeping in treetops and gathering food throughout the day.
While it is skilled at climbing trees, it gathers food by snapping them and collecting whatever berries or fruits fall down.
It will mark trees bearing delicious fruit in its territory with its claws.
Ursaring's sense of smell can distinguish any aroma, and as such it can find food buried deep underground or in streams.
As demonstrated in the anime, Ursaring is highly protective of its young, and has been shown to become more aggressive during mating season.

With its ability to distinguish any aroma, it unfailingly finds all food buried deep underground.
Although it has a large body, it is quite skilled at climbing trees.
It eats and sleeps in the treetops.
In the forests inhabited by Ursaring, it is said that there are many streams and towering trees where they gather food.
This Pokémon walks through its forest gathering food every day.
