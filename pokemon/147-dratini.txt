Dratini is a serpentine Pokémon with a blue body and a white underside.
It has white, three-pronged fins on the sides of its head and a white bump on its forehead.
Above its large, round, white snout are oval, purple eyes.

As Dratini is filled with life energy, it is constantly growing, and can thus reach lengths of over six feet.
As it grows, it sheds its skin regularly.
Whenever Dratini undergoes shedding, it hides behind a large waterfall.
Although this Pokémon was originally thought to be nothing more than a myth, it has been found in colonies living underwater.


It grows by molting repeatedly.
Boots made from the tanned cast-off skin are a super luxury item.
After a 10-hour struggle, a fisherman was able to pull one up and confirm its existence.
It's still weak, so it lurks on the floor of bodies of water, eating whatever food sinks down and living a quiet life.
It sheds its skin—almost on a daily basis—and grows larger.
Its skin is soft just after it's been shed.
