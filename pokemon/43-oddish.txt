Oddish resembles a blue plant bulb with a round body, beady red eyes, and oval, foot-like roots.
Five large, green leaves sprout from its head.
As demonstrated in the anime, these leaves are prehensile and can be used to scale vertical surfaces and catch light objects.

Known by the scientific name Oddium Wanderus, Oddish lives in grasslands.
A nocturnal Pok√©mon, Oddish buries its sensitive body in the ground during the day to avoid the sun and fool predators.
If its leaves are pulled in this state, it will respond by shrieking horribly.
It starts to move when its leaves begin absorbing moonlight, which it uses to grow.
Oddish will wander up to 1000 feet (300 meters) during the night to scatter its seeds and find a nutrient-rich patch of soil in which to plant itself.
The more fertile the earth, the glossier its leaves will be.
It is thought that its feet become like tree roots while planted.
In the past, Petal Dance was its signature move.

During the day, it stays in the cold underground to avoid the sun. It grows by bathing in moonlight.
Its scientific name is "Oddium Wanderus." At night, it is said to walk nearly 1,000 feet on its two roots.
