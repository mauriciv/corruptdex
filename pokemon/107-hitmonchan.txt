Hitmonchan is a tan, humanoid Pokémon that is exclusively male.
There are five blunt protrusions on top of its head, and it has extensions resembling pads over its shoulders.
It appears to be wearing a light purple tunic and kilt, as well as red boxing gloves and light purple boxing shoes.
As this appearance suggests, Hitmonchan specializes in punching.
It is able to throw punches too quick to be seen with the naked eye.
By punching with a corkscrew motion, it is even capable of drilling through concrete.
However, Hitmonchan requires a break every three minutes while fighting.
Despite the need for frequent breaks, it has an unwavering spirit and will never give up in a difficult situation.
Usually found in urban areas, it is rarely seen in the wild.

The arm-twisting punches it throws pulverize even concrete.
It rests after three minutes of fighting.
The spirit of a pro boxer has infused this Pokémon.
It throws punches that are faster than a bullet train.
