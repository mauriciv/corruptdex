Butterfree resembles a vaguely anthropomorphic butterfly with a purple body.
Unlike true insects, it only has two body segments and four light blue legs.
The upper pair of legs resemble small, three-fingered hands, while the lower pair resemble long, digit-less feet.
Butterfree has two black antennae, a light blue snout with two fangs underneath, and large, red compound eyes.
Its two pairs of veined wings are white with black accents.
The oval scales of a female Butterfree's lower wings are black, but white in males.

Butterfree's wings are covered with poisonous powders that fall off continuously as it flies.
This powder repels water, enabling it to gather honey even in the rain.
Butterfree will roam up to six miles from its nest in search of honey, which it carries with the hairs of its legs.
It also consumes sap from trees pierced by Heracross, as seen in the anime.
Butterfree is found in forests, but has also been observed flying near the ocean as part of its migratory breeding pattern.

Close examination of its large eyes reveals that each eye is composed of a myriad of tiny eyes.
When attacked by other Pok√©mon, it defends itself by scattering its poisonous scales and fluttering its wings.
