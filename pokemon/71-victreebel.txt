Victreebel has a bell-shaped body with a gaping mouth that has two sharp teeth.
Its semicircular eyes appear directly under its mouth and it has several dark green spots on its body.
Covering Victreebel's mouth is a leaf with a long, brown, yellow-tipped vine growing out of it.
The vine is flicked to mimic an animal in order to attract prey.
Victreebel also produces a sweet scent to further aid in luring its victims.
Acid that has dissolved numerous prey animals becomes sweeter and even more effective at attracting prey.

Said to live in huge colonies deep in jungles, although no one has ever returned from there.
Once ingested into this Pok√©mon's body, even the hardest object will melt into nothing.
