As a crustacean, Krabby has a strong outer shell protecting its small body.
Its upper half is red, containing two small spikes facing upwards on the top of its head.
Its lower body is light tan and doubles as its jaw with two fangs overlapping its upper body.
Its hips are visible on the lower front of its body connected to its long, thin legs, which have small, claw-like feet.
The main feature of Krabby's body is its large, red pincers.
Krabby uses them as its main form of offense, and as a form of balance.
Sometimes, Krabby may lose a claw during battle, or it can forcibly remove a claw if it is damaged, and regenerate the claw over a short period.

In the wild, Krabby lives near the edge of water in both fresh and salt water.
Krabby is most commonly found on beaches where it burrows in the sand to live.
In times of scarce food sources, it may eat sand to regain nutrients, and will be very aggressive in defending its home.
Its main form of defense is creating foam to shroud its body, in order to confuse opponents into thinking that it is bigger than it actually is.
As seen in the anime, on average, Krabby generally keeps to itself, but will quickly defend itself if provoked.

If it senses danger approaching, it cloaks itself with bubbles from its mouth so it will look bigger.
It can be found near the sea.
The large pincers grow back if they are torn out of their sockets.
