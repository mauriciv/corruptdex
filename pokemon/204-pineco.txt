Pineco is a blue-green, pinecone-like Pokémon with red eyes and no visible limbs.
It has a single spike on top of its head, which is supposedly its stem.
It makes its shell thicker by gluing tree bark to its body.
The glue is made of fluid that Pineco spits out, which hardens when it is exposed to air.
Unbothered by the added weight of its shell, it patiently hangs from a tree branch to wait for flying insect prey.
In Alola, its favorite prey is Cutiefly.
Typically immobile, it will drop to the ground and explode if someone shakes its tree while it is eating.

It likes to make its shell thicker by adding layers of tree bark.

Its shell protects it from bird Pokémon that peck it by mistake.
Pineco hangs from a tree branch and patiently waits for prey to come along.
If the Pokémon is disturbed while eating by someone shaking its tree, it drops down to the ground and explodes with no warning.
