Unown is a flat, thin Pokémon shaped like an eye with appendages that make it resemble a letter or a punctuation mark.
It is entirely black, except for its white sclerae.
All twenty-six alphabetic forms of Unown have fully open eyes while the two punctuation Unown have half-closed eyes.
Though each of its forms has a counterpart in the Latin alphabet, Unown is said to resemble ancient writing and hieroglyphs.
It is a mystery whether Unown predates or postdates written language, and therefore which one is based on the other.

The Pokédex and Professor Oak's research disagree on whether Unown communicates using electromagnetic waves or telepathy.
Either way, it can be detected by the Pokégear radio, which interprets it as the melody of the Azure Flute.
It is said that an "odd power" emerges when more than one Unown come together.
In the anime, it is capable of reading the thoughts of other life forms.
