Dragonite is a draconic, bipedal Pokémon with light orange skin.
It has large, grayish-green eyes and a round snout with small nostrils.
A pair of long, thin antennae sprout from the top of its head, with a small horn set between them.
Its striated underbelly is cream-colored, and extends from its neck to the tip of its long, tapering tail.
It has thick arms and legs ending in three claws each.
The leg joints are well defined, while its arms have a smooth, rounded appearance.
Dragonite's wings are small relative to its body, with teal wing membranes.

Despite its bulky build, Dragonite is capable of flying faster than the speed of sound.
It can circle the globe in sixteen hours, traveling roughly 1,556 mph (2,505 km/h), or about three times the speed of an average airplane.
A kindhearted Pokémon with human-like intelligence, Dragonite shows signs of altruism: it is said to save humans from drowning and lead lost or foundering ships to safety.
As demonstrated in the anime, however, it will go on an uncontrollable, destructive rampage if its environment is threatened.
Dragonite is very rare in the wild, typically living near the sea.
Some claim that there is an island somewhere in the ocean that only Dragonite inhabit.

This Pokémon saved a shipwrecked man, taking him to a remote island—a paradise occupied solely by Dragonite.
Incur the wrath of this normally calm Pokémon at your peril, because it will smash everything to smithereens before it's satisfied.
It flies over raging seas as if they were nothing.
Observing this, a ship's captain dubbed this Pokémon “the sea incarnate”.
You'll often hear tales of this kindhearted Pokémon rescuing people or Pokémon that are drowning.
