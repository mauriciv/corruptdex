Haunter is a purple Pok√©mon with a gaseous body.
It has a round head with a pair of disembodied hands.
Each hand has three pointed fingers.
Its head is flanked by three large, spiked protrusions on either side, and its eyes are large and triangular with small pupils.
The gases composing its head curve down to form several pointed teeth framing a pink mouth and a long tongue.
Its body tapers into a jagged tail.

Haunter hides in very dark places, where it plots to take the life of the next living thing that comes near it.
It silently stalks its victim and steals its life force with a lick from its gaseous tongue, which inflicts convulsions that persists until the victim dies.
It has the ability to float through solid walls.
Despite its predatory nature, it has been known to entertain and prank people in the anime.
Additionally, it has even been shown to feel intense loyalty to a deceased Trainer.
Haunter lives in dark, abandoned caves.

It strikes at humans from total darkness.
Those licked by its cold tongue grow weaker with each passing day until they die.
It fears the light and revels in the dark.
It may be on the verge of extinction in cities that stay brightly lit at night.
