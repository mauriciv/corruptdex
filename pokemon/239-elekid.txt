Elekid is a yellow, round-bodied Pokémon with black stripes.
Elekid's arms are bulky in proportion to its body, and it has three claws instead of fingers.
It has two stripes on its arms, which wrap all the way around.
There are two horns on top of its head which resemble the prongs of a plug, complete with holes in their sides.
Elekid has a black lightning bolt marking on its chest.
Two rows of stripes are near the marking, with the pattern continuing around its lower back.
Its legs are black, and its feet are rounded and toeless.

Elekid tends to play out in the middle of thunderstorms.
By rotating its arms, it generates electricity.
However, it tires easily and can only charge a small amount.
A weak electrical charge travels between its horns as well.
It lives in the grasslands.

It generates electricity by whirling its arms.
However, it can't store the energy it makes.
Spinning its arms around to generate electricity makes the area between its horns shine light blue.
Elekid stores electricity in its body.
If it touches metal and accidentally discharges all its built-up electricity, this Pokémon begins swinging its arms in circles to recharge itself.

When it's in a house, electrical outlets serve as its baby bottles.
It sucks down electricity.
This Pokémon is constantly fighting with Togedemaru that try to steal its electricity.
It's a pretty even match.
When it hears the crash of thunder, Elekid's mood improves.
It can be useful to record that sound and play it when Elekid's feeling down.
When its horns shine a bluish white, that's the sign it's fully charged.
You'll get a shocking jolt if you touch it.
