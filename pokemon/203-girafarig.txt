Girafarig is a hoofed quadruped Pokémon with a long neck.
There is a white blaze on its muzzle, which ends with its round, pink nose.
It has two horns with bulbous tips on top of its head.
Its front half is yellow with black spots, while its back half is black with yellow spots.
The female Girafarig has a smaller dark section than the male.
There are many triangular, pink spikes along its back.

Girafarig's tail possesses a head of its own.
The tail's head has yellow eyes, a mouth full of sharp teeth, and a small brain.
However, this head is incapable of independent thinking and relies on outside stimuli such as smell to guide its actions.
If the tail smells something alluring, it will bite.
The tail often mimics the head during feeding, and is able to warn the Pokémon of danger if it is sleeping.
Girafarig lives in wide-open plains, where it feeds on the plant life.

While it sleeps, the head on its tail keeps watch.
The tail doesn't need to sleep.
Its tail has a small brain of its own.
Beware! If you get close, it may react to your scent by biting.
Girafarig's rear head also has a brain, but it is small.
The rear head attacks in response to smells and sounds.
Approaching this Pokémon from behind can cause the rear head to suddenly lash out and bite.
Girafarig's rear head contains a tiny brain that is too small for thinking.
However, the rear head doesn't need to sleep, so it can keep watch over its surroundings 24 hours a day.
