Sentret is a small, furry Pokémon with a big round body, stubby arms, and two small feet.
Its fur is light brown, and it has a tail with dark brown stripes that it uses to stand on to see if there is danger nearby.
It has long dark brown ears, a white ring on its belly, and white paw pads.
While it is capable of standing on its hind legs, it usually moves on all four.
Sentret behaves very nervously and cautiously, apparently fearing for its life.
It will not sleep alone, and usually sleeps while another of its kind watches for danger.
When one sees a predator, it warns the rest in its pack, and they all flee.
Sentret can most commonly be found in grasslands.

When acting as a lookout, it warns others of danger by screeching and hitting the ground with its tail.
It stands on its tail so it can see a long way.
If it spots an enemy, it cries loudly to warn its kind.
When Sentret sleeps, it does so while another stands guard.
The sentry wakes the others at the first sign of danger.
When this Pokémon becomes separated from its pack, it becomes incapable of sleep due to fear.
