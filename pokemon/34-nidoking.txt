Nidoking is a large, bipedal, purple Pok√©mon with distinct reptilian features.
It has narrow eyes, large, spiny ears, fur-like tufts on its cheeks, and a short snout filled with pointed teeth.
There is a long, venomous horn on its forehead and a ridge of spines down its back.
Gray plates cover its chest and belly, and there is a gray rounded spine on each elbow.
Each hand was three claws, while foot has only a single hoof-like nail.
It has a long, powerful tail.
This is a male only species; the female counterpart is Nidoqueen.

It is said that Nidoking's tail is capable of toppling a metal transmission tower.
Nidoking uses this tail to smash, constrict, or break the bones of its prey and enemies.
The tail can be swung to create distance between it and its foes before Nidoking charges.
Its steel-like hide adds to its powerful, rampaging charges.
Nidoking lives in grasslands.

It is recognized by its rock-hard hide and its extended horn. Be careful with the horn, as it contains venom.
One swing of its mighty tail can snap a telephone pole as if it were a matchstick.
