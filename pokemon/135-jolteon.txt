Jolteon is a quadruped, mammalian Pokémon.
It is covered in yellow fur with a spiky fringe around its tail and a white ruff around its neck.
Its ears are large and pointed, and its eyes and small nose are black.
It has slender legs and small paws, each with three toes and a pink paw pad.
In addition to the ability to become sharp like needles, Jolteon's fur also amplifies the electrical charges produced by its cells.
It can also store and generate negative ions in its fur, which create a sparking noise.
This Pokémon is most often found in cities and towns under the ownership of Trainers.

They send out electrical charges of about 10,000 volts.
Because they are high-strung, it can be difficult to grow close to them.
When its fur stands on end, that's a sign it's about to give off a jolt of electricity.
Take care, as sometimes lightning strikes next to it, too.
Its lungs contain an organ that creates electricity.
The crackling sound of electricity can be heard when it exhales.
Its fur stands on end, becoming like needles it fires at enemies.
Once they're weakened, it finishes them off with a 10,000 volt shock.
