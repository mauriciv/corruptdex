Corsola is a small, pink, roundish Pokémon with branch-like growths on its back, which are similar to coral.
There is a smaller, blunt horn on its forehead, and it has black, oval eyes.
It has a white underside, which speckles towards the sides.
Its four legs and two arms are blunt and stubby.
Found in the warm shallow waters of southern seas, Corsola requires clean water to live.
If its habitat is dirty, the growths on its back become discolored and degenerate.
However, when it is healthy, its growths regularly shed and grow back.
It is able to regrow them over the course of a single night.
It forms large social groups.
Occasionally these groups get so large that people may live atop them, as is the case in Pacifidlog Town.

Mareanie and Toxapex are natural predators of Corsola.

It continuously sheds and grows.
The tip of its head is prized as a treasure because of its beauty.
They prefer unpolluted southern seas.
Their coral branches lose their color and deteriorate in dirty water.
Corsola's branches glitter very beautifully in seven colors when they catch sunlight.
If any branch breaks off, this Pokémon grows it back in just one night.
Clusters of Corsola congregate in warm seas where they serve as ideal hiding places for smaller Pokémon.
When the water temperature falls, this Pokémon migrates to the southern seas.

Coral branches grow from its head.
They break off quite easily, but they grow back in about three days.
Pursued by Mareanie for the branches on its head, this Pokémon will sometimes snap its own branches off as a diversion while it escapes.
The pink of Corsola that live in Alola is deep and vibrant, thanks to seas filled with nutrition.
In Alola, where their natural enemies Mareanie are plentiful, many Corsola have stubby branches on their heads.
