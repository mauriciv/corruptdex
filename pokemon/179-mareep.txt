Mareep is a sheep-like Pok√©mon with fluffy cream-colored wool covering its entire body, as well as a curly tuft of wool in the middle of its head.
Its head is blue, and it has black eyes.
Its four feet are blue and have two digits on each foot, and it appears to be on tiptoe at all times.
Its conical ears and tail have a yellow-and-black striped pattern.
Mareep has an orange sphere at the end of its tail, which acts like a small light bulb.
This sphere glows brighter the more electricity it has.

Mareep's wool, which grows continuously, stores electricity, rubbing together and building a static charge.
Its volume increases when it builds up with electricity.
Touching the wool when it is charged will result in a static shock.
During the summer, the fleece is shed, but it grows back in a week.
Air is also stored in its fur, which allows it to stay cool during summer and warm during winter.
It tends to avoid battle in the wild and has a mild disposition.
Mareep is most often found in grassy fields, though it can also be found in farms where its wool is used in high-quality clothing.

Its fluffy coat swells to double when static electricity builds up.
Touching it can be shocking.
It stores lots of air in its soft fur, allowing it to stay cool in summer and warm in winter.
Mareep's fluffy coat of wool rubs together and builds a static charge.
The more static electricity is charged, the more brightly the lightbulb at the tip of its tail glows.


Clothing made from Mareep's fleece is easily charged with static electricity, so a special process is used on it.
Rubbing its fleece generates electricity.
You'll want to pet it because it's cute, but if you use your bare hand, you'll get a painful shock.
