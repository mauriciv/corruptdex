Pinsir is a bipedal Pokémon with a wide, dull brown body and a large pair of gray, spiky pincers on top of its head.
In its mouth are many long, flat teeth arranged horizontally.
Its legs are short and thick while its arms are long and thin, and each limb ends with three grey claws.
Pinsir's limbs and abdomen are divided into segments.
Its eyes are simple, but usually appear angry.

As Mega Pinsir, it gains a large pair of clear wings with an area of orange venation.
Additionally, a set of wing coverings appear.
On each wing cover is a pair of large, thin, orange blades.
Its arms become longer and more segmented, with triangular extensions on its lower arms.
The pincers on its head are now longer with larger spikes, and its eyes are now yellow.
When it Mega Evolves, Pinsir is left in a constant state of excitement.
Mega Pinsir can travel up to 30 mph and uses its two large horns to pierce its enemies before shredding them.

It can use its pincers to crush, toss, bludgeon, or tear opponents, lift things twice its weight, and shatter logs.
Captured prey is kept in place by the piercing thorns and sheer strength of Pinsir's horns, and will not be released until they are torn in half.
In addition to hunting prey, the anime has shown that it enjoys tree sap.
Pinsir lives deep in the forest, where it burrows underground or hides in the treetops on nights cold enough to render it immobile.

In Alola, it has a rivalry with Vikavolt.

It grips its prey in its pincers and splits them apart.
Although it is a powerful Pokémon, it can't deal with the cold.
One solid blow from its horns is enough to split apart a large tree.
Its greatest rival in Alola is Vikavolt.
It gets into territorial disputes with Vikavolt.
For some reason, it apparently gets along well with Heracross in Alola.
Although it's tough, it can't handle cold well.
When night falls, it buries itself in leafage and sleeps.
