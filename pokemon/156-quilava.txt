Quilava is a slim quadruped Pokémon.
The top half of its body is blue, while the lower half is cream.
Its ears are triangular with red insides, and it possesses a rounded nose and red eyes.
It has five red spots on its body that can project flames: two in a somewhat exclamation-mark shape on its forehead and three lined up horizontally on its rear.
The fire coming from its head and rear can be launched as a flame attack.
It also uses gusts of superheated air as a battle technique.
Quilava's fur is non-flammable, so it can withstand flame attacks.
Quilava tends to be rare in the wild, but can sometimes be found living on grasslands.

Before battle, it turns its back on its opponent to demonstrate how ferociously its fire blazes.
Be careful if it turns its back during battle.
It means that it will attack with the fire on its back.
Quilava keeps its foes at bay with the intensity of its flames and gusts of superheated air.
This Pokémon applies its outstanding nimbleness to dodge attacks even while scorching the foes with flames.
