Rhyhorn is a rhinoceros-like creature with a body covered in gray, rocky plates.
Its underside and rear are smooth, and it has four short legs with two claws on each foot.
It has a triangular head with narrow, red eyes, two fangs protruding from its upper jaw, and small, triangular openings on the upper sides.
A spiked ridge runs along its back, and it has a single short horn on the tip of its snout.
The female has a shorter horn than the male.
In addition to its rocky hide, its bones are a thousand times harder than human bones.

Rhyhorn's brain is very small, giving it a one-track mind.
When it runs, it forgets why it started and continues until it falls asleep.
However, it may recall the reason upon demolishing something.
Rhyhorn runs in a straight line due to its short legs making it inept at turning.
It does not care if obstacles get in the way, merely smashing through them or sending them flying.
Sometimes it may feel pain the day after a collision.
Rhyhorn lives in rough terrain.

Strong, but not too bright, this Pok√©mon can shatter even a skyscraper with its charging Tackles.
It is inept at turning because of its four short legs.
It can only charge and run in one direction.
