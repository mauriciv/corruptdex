Natu is a tiny, mostly green bird Pokémon with a nearly spherical body, and accents of red, yellow and black.
It possesses brightly colored, yellow-and-red wings with thick black stripes.
The wings are small and not fully-grown, thus making it unable to fly.
However, it can hop and climb tree trunks.
Natu has a red crest on the top of its head, and its three-toed feet and three tail feathers are red as well.
Natu also has almond-shaped eyes and a yellow beak.

Natu is believed to be native to South America, although it can be found near ruins and in forests in other areas of the world.
Natu usually forages for food on the ground.
However, on rare occasions, it will hop onto branches to peck at the tree's new shoots.
It also picks food from cactus plants, easily avoiding the buds and spines.
Due to its prophetic abilities, Natu is a very cautious Pokémon that is easily spooked.
It has the quirky behavior of staring at something until the thing moves.

Because its wings aren't yet fully grown, it has to hop to get around.
It is always staring at something.
It usually forages for food on the ground but may, on rare occasions, hop onto branches to peck at shoots.
Natu cannot fly because its wings are not yet fully grown.
If your eyes meet with this Pokémon's eyes, it will stare back intently at you.
But if you move even slightly, it will hop away to safety.
Natu has a highly developed jumping ability.
The Pokémon flaps and leaps onto tree branches that are taller than grown-up people to pick at the tree's new shoots.

Although it still can't fly, its jumping power is outstanding.
It jumps way up into trees and plucks the buds from the branches.
The look in its eyes gives the impression that it's carefully observing you.
If you approach it, Natu will hop away.
