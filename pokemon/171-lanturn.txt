Lanturn is a large, blue fish-like Pokémon with small, blue pectoral fins.
It has a yellow "mask" over its red eyes.
The lower half of its caudal fin is yellow and has jagged edges.
A Y-shaped antenna with a teardrop-shaped orb on each tip sprouts from its back.
This structure comes from a modification of its dorsal fin.
These orbs contain a colony of bacteria that create a chemical reaction, which generates electricity in a similar fashion to that of a battery.
Lanturn uses the bright part of its body to lure fish prey.
It then blinds the prey with an intense burst of light, and swallows the immobilized prey in a single gulp.
Lanturn inhabits the ocean at depths of over three miles.

Lanturn's light can shine up from great depths.
It is nicknamed "The Deep-Sea Star".
It blinds prey with an intense burst of light.
With the prey incapacitated, the Pokémon swallows it in a single gulp.
Lanturn is nicknamed "the deep-sea star" for its illuminated antenna.
This Pokémon produces light by causing a chemical reaction between bacteria and its bodily fluids inside the antenna.
Lanturn is known to emit light.
If you peer down into the dark sea from a ship at night, you can sometimes see this Pokémon's light rising from the depths where it swims.
It gives the sea an appearance of a starlit night.

Should you peer into the ocean at night and see a light shining like the stars, that is Lanturn.
This Pokémon flashes a bright light that blinds its prey.
This creates an opening for it to deliver an electrical attack.
When the bacteria living inside its antennae absorb Lanturn's bodily fluids, a strong luminescent effect is produced.
It lives far down in the depths of the ocean.
It blinds its prey with light, using the moment they're dazzled to swallow them whole.
