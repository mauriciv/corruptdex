Pidgeotto is a raptor-like avian Pokémon.
It is covered with brown feathers, and has a cream-colored face, underside, and flight feathers.
It has a crest of pinkish-red feathers on its head and black, angular markings behind its eyes.
The plumage of its tail has alternating red and yellow feathers with ragged tips.
Its beak and legs are pink.
Two of its toes point forward, while one points backward.
Additionally, it has powerful, sharp talons that it uses to grasp prey.

Pidgeotto is a powerful flier capable of carrying prey several miles to its nest.
It has amazing vision, which helps it locate preferred prey Pokémon such as Exeggcute and Magikarp.
The anime has also shown it preying on Caterpie.
Pidgeotto claims a sprawling territory of more than 60 miles, which it defends fiercely.
Its nest is usually in the center of its territory and it circles its territory throughout the day, looking out for food and intruders.
It is most often found in forests.
Gust and Feather Dance are its former signature moves.

The claws on its feet are well developed. It can carry prey such as an Exeggcute to its nest over 60 miles away.
Very protective of its sprawling territorial area, this Pokémon will fiercely peck at any intruder.
