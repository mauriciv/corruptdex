Arcanine is a quadruped, canine Pokémon with an orange pelt marked by jagged black stripes.
It has diamond-shaped ears with beige insides, black eyes, a round, black nose, and two pointed teeth protruding from its upper jaw.
Its head, muzzle, and chest are covered in shaggy, beige fur, except for two oval sections around each eye and ear.
Long tufts of fur grow behind its knees and around its ankles.
Its underside is black, and it has a billowing, beige tail that is bent in the middle.
Each paw has three toes and a round, pink pad.

Arcanine is a fiercely brave and loyal Pokémon.
It is capable of running 6,200 miles (10,000 kilometers) in 24 hours with a speed and grace reminiscent of flight.
Additionally, the move Extreme Speed was its signature move in the past.
Arcanine has long been admired for its beauty and speed, and anyone who hears its bark will grovel before it.
The source of its power is a flame blazing wildly inside its body.
In the anime, it was shown that it stashes food in its mane and carries it to its nest for its young.
Arcanine lives on prairies, and Pokémon Snap has also shown it living in active volcanoes.

Overflowing with beauty and majesty, this strong Pokémon appears in ancient Eastern folklore.
The fire burning inside its body serves as the energy to fuel it as it runs great distances.
It appears in many legends.
