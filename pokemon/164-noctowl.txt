Noctowl bears similarity to an owl with brown plumage and has a darker brown triangle pattern of feathers running down its chest.
Its wings and wedge-shaped tail are dark brown, while the undersides of its wings are light brown.
It has bushy, cream-colored feather 'horns' that look similar to a trident or eyebrows.
The ring pattern around its eyes and its talons are cream colored, and Noctowl's beak and talons are light pink.
Additionally, Noctowl has large, red eyes.
As shown in the anime, Noctowl can grow a small beard in its elderly stages.

Noctowl is a nocturnal Pokémon.
It has exceptional hearing and eyesight, can fly silently, and can turn its heads at a 180° angle to increase its intellect.
Noctowl is most commonly found nesting in trees and forests.

Its eyes are specially adapted.
They concentrate even faint light and enable it to see in the dark.
When it needs to think, it rotates its head 180 degrees to sharpen its intellectual power.
Noctowl never fails at catching prey in darkness.
This Pokémon owes its success to its superior vision that allows it to see in minimal light, and to its soft, supple wings that make no sound in flight.

With eyes that can see in pitch-darkness, it never lets its prey escape.
Some even call it “the emperor of dark nights”.
When it turns its head entirely upside down, you know it's troubled by something.
If you don't leave it be, it will peck you.
