Chansey is a pink, ovoid Pokémon.
There are three hair-like growths on the sides of its head, tipped with a darker shade of pink.
On the center of its belly is a dark pink pouch that contains a single white egg.
Its arms are stubby, and it has small, dark pink feet.
Additionally, it has a short tail.
It is a female-only species with no male counterpart.

Chansey lays several nutritious eggs every day, which it carefully carries in its pouch.
A kindhearted Pokémon, it will share these eggs with injured people and Pokémon.
The eggs become more delicious if Chansey is raised with love and care.
Chansey is extremely rare in the wild, and is said to bring good luck and happiness to those who manage to catch it.
It is more commonly found in urban settings.

The eggs laid by Chansey are rich in nutrients and a favorite food of many Pokémon.
Not only are these Pokémon fast runners, they're also few in number, so anyone who finds one must be lucky indeed.
