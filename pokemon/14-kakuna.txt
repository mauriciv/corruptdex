Kakuna is a yellow, cocoon Pokémon.
Kakuna has a dome-shaped head and black, triangular eyes.
It has two scythe-like arms in the middle of its body.
When it comes close to evolving, its body gives off heat that makes it warm to the touch.
Kakuna remains virtually immobile and waits for evolution often hanging from tree branches by long strands of silk.
When attacked, however, it can extend its poison barbs.
Kakuna nests in forests and misty wooded areas.
Occasionally, it will also nest at the mouths of tunnels and caves, as seen in Pokémon Snap.

Almost incapable of moving, this Pokémon can only harden its shell to protect itself when it is in danger.
While awaiting evolution, it hides from predators under leaves and in nooks of branches.
