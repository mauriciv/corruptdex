There is a small horn on its forehead, and single spine on each ear, and there is a line of toxic spikes running down the length of its back.
Each hand has three short claws and each foot was two claws.
Its lower jaw, the front of its abdomen, and two plates on its chest are cream-colored.

Nidoqueen can be quite fierce and is very protective over its young.
This Pokémon is at its strongest when it is defending its young, and will try to seal the entrance to its burrow to protect them.
When in contact with foes, it can poison them with the spikes from its back or cause small tremors by slamming the ground.
It is also adept at sending foes flying with harsh tackles and it uses its hefty bulk to execute powerful moves.
Nidoqueen lives in hot savannas and plains.

The body is covered by stiff, needle-like scales. If it becomes excited, the needles bristle outwards.
