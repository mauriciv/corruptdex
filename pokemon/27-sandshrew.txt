Sandshrew is a bipedal mammalian Pokémon, but runs on all fours in the anime.
Its yellow hide is dry, tough, blends in with desert sand, and has a brick pattern, but its underbelly and muzzle are white.
Sandshrew has blue, almond-shaped eyes, a pointed snout, and triangular ears with white insides.
Its tail is thick and conical.
It has two long claws on each foot and three sharp claws on its forepaws, which are used to burrow.

Sandshrew spends much of its time hidden underground in deep burrows.
It only emerges to hunt, which it does by waiting within its burrow to instantly lunge out and drag in passing prey.
Sandshrew can quickly curl into a tight ball to protect itself from great falls and opponents, but may also throw sand at attackers.
While its body can efficiently absorb water to facilitate life in the desert, Sandshrew has been found in caves as well.

In the Alola region, Sandshrew migrated to snowy mountains due to the volcanic activity near the desert areas.
Its body is a light, icy blue and with a cream-colored belly and muzzle.
Its head now resembles an igloo.
Thicker plates form a dome around its head and its ears resemble an igloo's entrances.
In adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier with a shell of ice covering its hide.
The steel-like covering grants it extra defense, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart.
Alolan Sandshrew's claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly.

It can roll its body into a ball. It moves through the desert by rolling at high speeds.
It usually makes its home in deserts and arid zones, where rain does not fall. It digs holes to catch Bug-type Pokémon.
It lives on snowy mountains. Its steel shell is very hard—so much so, it can't roll its body up into a ball.
An ancient tradition of Alolan festivals, still carried on to this day, is a competition to slide Sandshrew across ice as far as one can.
