Granbull is a purple, bipedal, bulldog-like Pokémon.
It has a prominent lower jaw with two long, fang-like growths.
Its upper jaw has two small fangs.
The jaws are so heavy that the Pokémon has trouble keeping its head up.
On the sides of its head are flat, curved ears, and its small nose is black.
There is a black collar around its neck with two small white markings on it.
Around its wrists are two black band markings, and it has a short tail.

Despite its fierce appearance, it is actually very timid.
Unless Granbull is startled, it will not bite indiscriminately.
If attacked, it will flail about to fend off its attacker.
Granbull wanders around urban areas.

It is timid in spite of its looks.
If it becomes enraged, however, it will strike with its huge fangs.
It can make most any Pokémon run away simply by opening its mouth wide to reveal its big fangs.
Granbull has a particularly well-developed lower jaw.
The enormous fangs are heavy, causing the Pokémon to tip its head back for balance.
Unless it is startled, it will not try to bite indiscriminately.

Its well-developed lower jaw and heavy fangs are its weapons.
As long as it's not provoked, it rarely bites.
More timid than Snubbull, this Pokémon is doted on by young people amused at the contrast between its looks and its attitude.
While it has powerful jaws, it doesn't care for disputes, so it rarely has a chance to display their might.
Although it's popular with young people, Granbull is timid and sensitive, so it's totally incompetent as a watchdog.
