Espeon is a quadruped, mammalian Pokémon with slender legs and dainty paws.
It is covered in fine, lilac fur.
This velvety fur is sensitive for Espeon to sense minute shifts in the air, thus allowing it to predict the weather.
Its ears are large, and it has purple eyes with white pupils.
There are tufts of fur near its eyes, and a small, red gem embedded in its forehead.
The gem boosts the psychic powers that it gained to protect its Trainer from harm.
It also has a thin, forked tail that quivers when it predicts its opponent's moves.
Espeon is rare in the wilderness, and is more commonly found in urban areas.

The tip of its forked tail quivers when it is predicting its opponent's next move.
Its fur is so sensitive, it can feel minute shifts in the air and predict the weather.
Espeon is extremely loyal to any Trainer it considers to be worthy.
It is said that this Pokémon developed its precognitive powers to protect its Trainer from harm.

It can instantaneously sense its opponent's movements by feeling air currents with its fine fur.
It unleashes psychic power from the orb on its forehead.
When its power is exhausted, the orb grows dull and dark.
Although it originally had no powers at all, people say its precognitive faculties were awakened by its need to protect itself.
Psychic power builds up in the orb on its forehead as it bathes in the sunshine.
Espeon is not good at battling at night.
