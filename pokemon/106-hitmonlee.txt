Hitmonlee is a humanoid Pok√©mon with an ovoid body.
Lacking a distinct neck and head, its upper torso has almond-shaped eyes with black rings around them and appears to lack a nose and mouth.
Primarily brown, it has cream-colored, segmented arms and legs, with three fingers and three clawed toes respectively.
The soles of its feet and its ankles have circular, yellow markings.
It is an exclusively male species with no female counterpart.

Hitmonlee's legs freely contract and stretch similar to a coiled spring.
This flexibility allows Hitmonlee to run with lengthy strides and gives it greater reach for its kicks.
Its excellent sense of balance enables it to kick in succession from any position.
After battling, it rubs down its legs to relax the tight muscles.
Rare in the wild, it is primarily found in urban areas.

The legs freely contract and stretch.
The stretchy legs allow it to hit a distant foe with a rising kick.
If it starts kicking repeatedly, both legs will stretch to strike a fleeing foe.
