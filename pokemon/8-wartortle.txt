Wartortle is a bipedal, indigo Pokémon similar to a turtle.
It has brown eyes, a dark blue streak on each cheek, and two sharp teeth protruding from its upper jaw.
It has three clawed fingers and pointed toes.
Pale blue fur covers its long ears and tail.
A brown shell with a pale yellow underside encases its body.
A thick, white rim separates the upper and lower halves of the shell.
As Wartortle grows old, its tail fur will darken, and it may have algae growing on its shell.
The shell may also carry scars from past battles.
To maintain balance while swimming at high speeds, Wartortle moves its furry ears and tail.
It can use the fur to store air for extended underwater diving.
Its tail is a popular symbol of longevity, making it popular with the elderly.
It hides in water when hunting and emerges to surprise its prey.
In the past, Skull Bash was its signature move.
The anime has shown that Wartortle can be found living in colonies on islands, but its preferred habitat seems to be freshwater ponds and lakes.

When tapped, this Pokémon will pull in its head, but its tail will still stick out a little bit.
It is said to live 10,000 years. Its furry tail is popular as a symbol of longevity.
