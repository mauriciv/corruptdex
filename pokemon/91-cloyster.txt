Cloyster is a black, pearl-like Pokémon.
It is encased inside a light grey shell, which is surrounded by a second jagged, blue-violet outer shell casing.
It has one barb-like spike protruding from above its head, and multiple conical horns on its outer shell.
Its shell is harder than diamond with spikes that are even harder; harsh tidal currents will affect the size and sharpness of these spikes.
On its pearl-like face, it has two white eyes and a mouth.
Aside from its face and head, its internal anatomy has never been seen.

It typically only opens its shell to attack an opponent.
However, it is fully capable of retaliating against any enemy with its shell tightly closed.
With rapid succession, it launches its spikes at the foe, keeping them repelled.
Once it has shut itself in, it is impossible to open its shell from the outside.
This impressive defense allows it to withstand anything from a bomb blast to even a missile strike.
The same projectile system it uses to launch its spikes is also used for swimming.
It swallows seawater, and then ejects it towards the rear propelling it through with siphon-jet propulsion.
It lives on the sea floor, nestled among the rocks and coral.

Its hard shell cannot be shattered—not even by a bomb.
The contents of the shell remain unknown.
Excavation of the tombs of ancient hunting tribes has turned up many spears tipped with spikes that had fallen off this Pokémon's shell.
