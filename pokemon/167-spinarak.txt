Spinarak is a green, arachnoid Pokémon.
It has black eyes with white pupils, a white horn on its head, red mandibles, and six yellow legs.
A greenish-black stripe encircles the middle of each leg and the end of its abdomen.
The greenish-black spots on its abdomen resemble a face that has been shown to change expression in the anime.
Spinarak is a patient hunter that can wait motionlessly for several days for unsuspecting prey to become trapped in its thin yet strong web, which it weaves in the forest.
It is even said to be able to identify what kind of prey is in its web just by their vibrations.

It waits intently until its preferred prey, Cutiefly, gets caught in its web.
In fact, it's quite a patient Pokémon.
Some fishermen weave its sturdy thread into nets to catch fish Pokémon.
With threads from its mouth, it fashions sturdy webs that won't break even if you set a rock on them.
Although the poison from its fangs isn't that strong, it's potent enough to weaken prey that gets caught in its web.
