Pupitar is encased inside a thick shell made of grayish-blue rock-its hardness comparable to that of bedrock.
Its red eyes can be seen through two holes in the shell, and two more holes directly above resemble eyebrows.
The upper portion of its body is covered by a mask-like plate with four large spikes on either side.
Three additional spikes protrude from its forehead.
While its arms and legs are developing inside the shell, Pupitar relieves itself by using vented gas to propel itself around, and can generate enough force to knock down mountains.
Pupitar lives and moves freely around harsh mountain ranges.

Its body is as hard as bedrock.
By venting pressurized gas, it can launch itself like a rocket.
Its shell is as hard as sheet rock, and it is also very strong.
Its thrashing can topple a mountain.
Pupitar creates a gas inside its body that it compresses and forcefully ejects to propel itself like a jet.
The body is very durable, it avoids damage even if it hits solid steel.

This troublesome Pok√©mon can't wait to evolve, so it relieves its stress by wildly propelling itself around using compressed gas.
This dangerous pupa thrashes about.
Its shell is as hard as bedrock, containing its gradually forming new body within.
