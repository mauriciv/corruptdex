Skiploom is a plant Pokémon that has a round, green body with stubby arms, feet, and tail.
It has large, flat ears on the sides of its head and oval, red eyes with no pupils.
On top of its head is a yellow bloom with a white center.
Skiploom spreads its petals to absorb as much sunlight as possible.
The bloom on top of its head opens and closes as the temperature fluctuates and its flower blossoms when the temperature rises above 64 °F (18 °C).
Because of this, it is sometimes used as a thermometer.
It floats in the air to try to get closer to the sun, but closes its flower and immediately hides under the shade of a tree when it rains.
Skiploom lives in grasslands.
