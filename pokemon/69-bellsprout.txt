Bellsprout is a plant-based Pok√©mon with a stem-like brown body.
This stem is long, thin and very flexible, making it capable of swerving rapidly to avoid many attacks or moving with blinding speed to capture prey.
Its roots resemble feet, and it uses them as such.
It will plant these feet in the ground to replenish water, but it is unable to flee while it is rooted.
It has one green leaf on each side of its body.
Its yellow head is bell-shaped and has what appear to be pink lips at the end.
Bellsprout prefers hot and humid places, living in forests.

Even though its body is extremely skinny, it is blindingly fast when catching its prey.
Its bud looks like a human face.
Because of the bud, it is rumored to be a type of legendary mandrake plant.
