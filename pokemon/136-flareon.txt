Flareon is a mammalian, quadruped Pok√©mon covered in short, reddish-orange fur.
It has long ears, dark eyes, and a small black nose.
There are three small toes and a yellow paw pad on each foot.
Fluffy yellow fur forms a small tuft on its head, as well as its bushy tail and a mane around its chest and neck.
It will fluff out its collar to cool down its high body temperature.
This high temperature is caused by its internal flame sac.
Flareon stores and heats inhaled air in this sac, and then exhales it as fire.
Flareon is mostly found in populated areas, and is rarely seen in the wilderness.

When it catches prey or finds berries, it breathes fire on them until they're well done, and then it gobbles them up.
Its average body temperature is between 1,300 and 1,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
In its internal flame sac, temperatures reach 3,000 degrees.
If it inhales deeply, that's a sign it's about to attack.
The flame chamber inside its body ignites when Flareon gets agitated, reaching temperatures of up to 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit.
