Magby is a bipedal Pokémon that has a red body with a yellow, flame-shaped marking on its stomach.
Its head is covered with large lumps, and it has a rounded, yellow beak.
There is a single spike on its back and it has a tapered tail.
Its short arms have three clawed fingers, while its feet have only two clawed toes.
Magby can breathe 1100 °F (600 °C) flames, and hot embers drip from its mouth.
Its health is determined by these flames.
Yellow flames show that a Magby is in good health, while flames mixed with a lot of smoke show that it is fatigued.
Magby normally lives in volcanic craters.
However, it can be seen living in towns.

It's small, but its body temperature is over 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.
Embers escape its mouth and nose when it breathes.
Its magma-like blood circulates throughout its body.
Its body's heat can top 1,100 degrees F.
Magby's state of health is determined by observing the fire it breathes.
If the Pokémon is spouting yellow flames from its mouth, it is in good health.
When it is fatigued, black smoke will be mixed in with the flames.


Many of these Pokémon can be seen in areas with volcanic activity.
Feeding can get them so excited, they exhale flames of 1,100 degrees F.
A famous potter lives with a Magby.
Apparently its soft flames produce fine works.
When flames drip from its nose, that means it has a cold.
Have it lie down for a nice rest in some magma.
Its body temperature is always around 1,100 degrees Fahrenheit.
If Magby falls into a small- enough pond, the whole thing will dry up.
