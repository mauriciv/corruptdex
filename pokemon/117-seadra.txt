Seadra is a blue, seahorse-like Pok√©mon.
It has a long snout and a two fin-like ridges curving over either side of its head.
Its belly is covered with rough, cream-colored scales.
Seadra's lower pectoral fins have sharp, pointed, cream-colored tips that exude venom.
It also has a large, coiled tail.

Seadra can swim in any direction while facing forward by rapidly flapping its fins and tail.
It catches its prey by spinning its body to create large whirlpools.
When its prey is exhausted, Seadra swallows it whole using its long snout.
Seadra's venom is toxic enough to induce fainting in humans, but is prized among practitioners of traditional medicine.

Seadra makes its nest by either wriggling between or anchoring itself to branches of coral under the ocean.
After a female Seadra gives birth, the male Seadra will take care of the young.
It is markedly vicious, and will mercilessly attack those who venture near its nest.

Its body bristles with sharp spikes.
Carelessly trying to touch it could cause fainting from the spikes.
It is capable of swimming backwards by rapidly flapping its winglike pectoral fins and stout tail.
