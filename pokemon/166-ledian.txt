Ledian is a large, mostly red, ladybug-like Pokémon.
It has two black antennae, a black neck, and a black spot in the center of its forehead.
A female Ledian's antennae are shorter than those of a male.
Its two eyes are large, blue, and slanted.
It has four black arms with white hands clenched into fists.
Its two legs are similar to its arms, but end with large red feet.
Its back is red with large black spots, and the undersides of the elytra are yellow.
It has a single pair of clear wings that can be folded underneath the elytra.

Ledian sleeps in forests in the daytime inside a big leaf.
When the stars flicker in the night sky, Ledian flutters about, scattering a glowing powder.
The star patterns on its back grow larger or smaller depending on the number of stars in the night sky.
It uses starlight as energy.
It fights by throwing a barrage of punches with its four arms; it uses quantity in an attempt to make up for its lack of strength in each punch.

When the stars flicker in the night sky, it flutters about, scattering a glowing powder.
The spot patterns on its back grow larger or smaller depending on the number of stars in the night sky.
It is said that in lands with clean air, where the stars fill the sky, there live Ledian in countless numbers.
There is a good reason for this—the Pokémon uses the light of the stars as its energy.

While it's believed that starlight provides it with energy, this Pokémon also loves to eat berries.
In the daytime, it curls up in the grass to sleep.
In battle, it throws punches with all four arms.
The power of each individual blow is piddly, so it aims to win by quantity rather than quality.
It's said that the patterns on its back are related to the stars in the night sky, but the details of that relationship remain unclear.
It flies through the night sky, sprinkling sparkly dust.
According to some, if that dust sticks to you, good things will happen to you.
