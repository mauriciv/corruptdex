Dragonair is a long, serpentine Pokémon with sky blue scales and a white underside.
Its violet eyes are dark and glossy.
It has a smooth, rounded snout and a small, white horn on its forehead.
Its head is flanked by two small, stylized wings, which are white and curve into a swirl at the base.
Three blue, crystal orbs, one on its neck and two on its tail, adorn its body.

Dragonair emits a gentle aura that gives it a mystical appearance.
As seen in the anime, it can make its wings grow larger in order to fly, but otherwise moves through the air unaided.
Dragonair hosts a large amount of energy within its body, which it can discharge through the crystal orbs on its neck and tail.
This causes its body to brighten and give off a different aura that changes the weather in its vicinity.
Dragonair is a rare Pokémon that inhabits seas and lakes.

It has long been thought that its crystalline orbs are imbued with the power to control the weather.
From time immemorial, it has been venerated by agricultural peoples as an entity able to control the weather.
Lakes where Dragonair live are filled with offerings from people, because they believe this Pokémon is able to control the weather.
Some say that if you see it at the start of the year, flying through the sky and twisting its body, you'll be healthy all year long.
