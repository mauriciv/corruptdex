Dugtrio is a set of Diglett triplets sharing a single body.
Each head has brown skin, black eyes, and a large, round, pink nose.
Dugtrio's three heads think the same thoughts and act cooperatively.
In order to make burrowing easier, each head will bob up and down to loosen the soil.
Dugtrio can tunnel under the earth at 60 mph (100 km/h) to a depth of 60 miles (100 km), triggering tremors and earthquakes.
It is capable of burrowing endlessly.
For a brief time, Fissure was its signature move.

Dugtrio lives in tunnels and caves under the earth.
As shown in the anime, it sometimes lives in hollow trees in forests.
It maintains the soil and plants trees to revitalize wooded areas.

The Alolan Dugtrio appears to look much like other Dugtrio apart from the golden hair each head sports.
One head has a bob-cut, the second has curly "shoulder-length" and the last one has flowing hair that touches the ground behind it.
This hair is made out of thin strands of steel and it grows slowly and continuously throughout the Dugtrio's life.
The Alolan Dugtrio is regarded as a feminine deity of the earth and taking its hairs are thought to bring bad luck.

This set of triplets moves cooperatively.
It's the power of teamwork that enables this Pokémon to dig to a depth of 60 miles.
Despite the closeness between this Pokémon and farmers and other people, no one has ever seen the parts of it concealed underground.
Its shining gold hair provides it with protection.
It's reputed that keeping any of its fallen hairs will bring bad luck.
These Pokémon are cherished in the Alola region, where they are thought to be feminine deities of the land incarnate.
