Croconaw is a medium-sized, bipedal, crocodilian Pok√©mon with a blue and yellow body.
Croconaw has three clusters of red spikes on its body: one with three points on its head like a crest, one with two points on its back, and a diamond-shaped spike on its tail.
Black markings surround its red eyes.
Its lower jaw is yellow and pronounced, and its chest has an asymmetrical, yellow pattern resembling a spotted animal skin.
Although Croconaw has been described as always having forty-eight fangs lining its mouth, only six are discernible with four visible when the mouth is closed.
It is capable of regrowing lost fangs.
Its teeth are positioned like barbed fishing hooks and are impossible to pull out with ordinary strength.
Croconaw can rarely be found near water.

If it loses a fang, a new one grows back in its place.
There are always 48 fangs lining its mouth.
Once it bites down, it won't let go until it loses its fangs.
New fangs quickly grow into place.
Once Croconaw has clamped its jaws on its foe, it will absolutely not let go.
Because the tips of its fangs are forked back like barbed fishhooks, they become impossible to remove when they have sunk in.
