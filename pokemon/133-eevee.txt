Eevee is a mammalian, quadruped creature with primarily brown fur.
The tip of its bushy tail and its large furry collar are cream-colored.
It has short, slender legs with three small toes and a pink paw pad on each foot.
Eevee has brown eyes, long pointed ears, and a small black nose.
This Pokémon is rarely found in the wild, and is mostly only found in cities and towns.
However, Eevee is said to have an irregularly shaped genetic structure that allows it to adapt to many different kinds of environments.
Eventually, Eevee may evolve to better suit its surroundings.
According to Pokémon Mystery Dungeon, Eevee has a naive personality.

Possessing an unbalanced and unstable genetic makeup, it conceals many possible evolutions.
Current studies show it can evolve into an incredible eight different species of Pokémon.
The question of why only Eevee has such unstable genes has still not been solved.
Its genes are easily influenced by its surroundings.
Even its face starts to look like that of its Trainer.
