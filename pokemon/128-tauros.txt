Tauros is a quadruped, bovine Pokémon.
It is covered in light brown fur with a thick, darker brown mane around the neck.
It has a rounded muzzle with a dark brown nose, and three gray bumps running vertically down its forehead.
A pair of curved, gray horns grows from atop its head.
Each of its three black tails has a tuft of fur on the end, and there is a single gray hoof on each foot.
Tauros is a male-only species with no true female counterpart.

Tauros is a violent, rowdy Pokémon that whips itself into a frenzy using its three tails.
Once it starts charging, it is unable to stop or change course until it hits something.
It lives and travels in herds on plains and grasslands.
It will lock horns with others of its kind, and the herd's protector takes pride in its battle-scarred horns.

Historically, people in areas all over the world have ridden Tauros, but the practice is said to have started in Alola.
Although it's known to be a fierce Pokémon, Tauros in the Alola region are said to possess a measure of calmness.
They live in groups.
The one with the longest, thickest, and most-scarred horns is the boss of the herd.
The climate seems to be related to the reason Tauros in Alola are a little calmer than those in other regions.
