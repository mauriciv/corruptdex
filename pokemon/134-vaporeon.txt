Vaporeon is a composite creature sharing physical traits of aquatic and land animals.
It is a quadruped with three small toes on each foot and dark blue paw pads on the hind feet.
Vaporeon's body is light blue with dark blue marking around its head and a ridge down its back.
This Pokémon has a split tailfin that has been mistaken for a mermaid's in the past.
It has a white ruff around its neck, and three fins around its head made of cream-colored webbing.
It is said that rain will come within a few hours if Vaporeon's fins begin to vibrate.

Vaporeon is mostly found in urban settings and is rarely seen in the wild, but it can also be found near clean, fresh lakes.
It has evolved to become better suited to an aquatic lifestyle.
In addition to developing gills, it has a cell composition similar to water molecules.
This structure allows Vaporeon to melt into water at will and keeps it camouflaged as it swims.

Its cells are composed of units much like water molecules.
It lives close to water and is often mistaken for a mermaid.
Blending in with the water and erasing all signs of its presence, it patiently waits for its prey, fish Pokémon.
Clean, clear waters are its usual habitat.
When it's about to be attacked by an invading enemy, it dives into the water to hide.
It detects nearby moisture with its fin.
When its fin begins trembling rapidly, that means rain will fall in a few hours.
