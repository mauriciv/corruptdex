On top of its head are three, light brown ridges.
Its arms are muscular with dark red, vertical stripes on them.
It possesses large pectoral muscles that protrude slightly over its belt.
The lower part of its body has black markings that resemble briefs.
It is always seen wearing a black and golden power-save belt resembling a Championship belt that regulates Machoke's strength.

Machoke is a Pokémon of immense strength.
Its muscles are as hard as steel, and it is capable of lifting extremely heavy objects with only one finger.
In spite of this, it is modest and often helps people with manual labor.
It can be found in the mountains, where it trains daily.

As a result of its continual workouts, it has developed tremendous power.
It uses that power to help people with their work.
It willingly assists with hard labor because it knows the work is good training for its muscles.
