Mankey is a primate Pokémon, similar to a New World monkey.
It is a bipedal Pokémon with a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur.
Its nose is similar to a pig’s snout, and it has red eyes and triangular ears with brown insides.
Mankey's hands, two-toed feet, and the tip of its curved, prehensile tail are brown.
Along with Stufful, it is the smallest Fighting-type Pokémon.

Mankey specializes in physical fighting, and is very aggressive and short-tempered.
When angry, Mankey begins shaking and its breathing turns rough.
Its rage peaks quickly, preventing its victim from being able to flee.
If Mankey loses sight of its colony, its loneliness causes it to become infuriated.
Mankey can be found in the mountains.
Mankey lives in treetop colonies, and if one becomes enraged, the whole colony rampages for no reason.

According to the Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team games, Mankey's preferred food is chestnuts, although Mankey usually lacks the dexterity to peel them.
Mankey will get agitated and rage after attempting to peel a chestnut's spiky shell.
Additionally, it also appears to be fond of bananas in the anime.

It can spontaneously become enraged.
Everyone near it clears out as it rampages and the resulting loneliness makes it angrier still.
Its raging tires it out and causes it to fall asleep, but the anger resonating in its dreams causes it to wake up—which infuriates it all over again.
