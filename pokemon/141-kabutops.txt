With a body closely resembling a living skeleton, Kabutops has a half-moon, disc shaped head, with two small, forward facing eyes.
Its body has a light gray chest plate with a brown shell resembling a visible backbone, containing three ribs protruding on each side and a thick pointed tail.
It does not have hands, but large, sharp, gray scythes.
Its legs are brown and thin, leading into small feet with two large gray claws.

Kabutops can tuck in its shell to help it swim extremely fast in its ocean home, where it can catch prey.
It uses its sharp scythes to cut enemies and drink their internal fluids.
Before it went extinct, it was in the process of evolving into a land dweller in order to catch prey that had already evolved into land dwelling species.
As seen in the anime, Kabutops greatly prefer to live in seclusion, and will become very hostile when provoked.


Its body had begun to change so it could function on land.
But it didn't adapt in time and went extinct.
It swims at speeds of roughly 29 knots, quickly closing in on its prey and slashing into them with its scythes to finish them off.
