Mantine is a large, manta ray-like Pokémon with wide fins and two ring-shaped marks on its back.
Its back is a dark blue with a jagged outline on its wings.
It has a streamer-like tail and long "antennae".
Two pairs of gills are visible on its gray underside, as well as a pair of beady eyes and a small mouth.
Generally, it is pictured with a Remoraid attached to the underside of one wing, much like a cleaner fish.
Mantine can fly in the air if it builds up enough speed, in a similar manner to how real-life manta rays breach the surface, and can soar gracefully out of the water.
Mantine is mostly docile.
It thrives in open seas.

In Alola, many surfers ride on backs of Mantine to ride waves and travel between islands.
This has made it an icon in the region, being featured on souvenir postcards and posters.

If it builds up enough speed swimming, it can fly over 300 feet out of the water from the surface of the ocean.
While elegantly swimming in the sea, it ignores Remoraid that cling to its fins seeking food scraps.
On sunny days, schools of Mantine can be seen elegantly leaping over the sea's waves.
This Pokémon is not bothered by the Remoraid that hitches rides.

Postcards and posters featuring Mantine leaping elegantly above the waves are popular souvenirs of Alola.
Many people have taken up surfing because they admire how magnificently Mantine swims.
