Furret is a tan creature that bears a strong resemblance to a ferret.
Its most notable feature is its long skinny body, which is used for slipping through the small entrances to its nest and squirm through small spaces to escape foes.
It has two brown lines on each cheek and cream-tipped ears.
It has four medium-sized brown rings from its tail to the middle of its torso and smaller brown rings on each of its forepaws.
However, its hind paws are cream-colored.
All of its paws have pink paw pads.
Furret is capable of standing on its hind legs, but prefers to move on all fours.
Despite its short limbs, Furret is very quick and agile.
It tends to burrow deep in the ground of meadows and other grasslands.

The mother puts its offspring to sleep by curling up around them.
It corners foes with speed.
It makes a nest to suit its long and skinny body.
The nest is impossible for other Pokémon to enter.
Furret has a very slim build.
When under attack, it can slickly squirm through narrow spaces and get away.
In spite of its short limbs, this Pokémon is very nimble and fleet.
