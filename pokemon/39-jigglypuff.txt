Jigglypuff is a round, pink ball with pointed ears and large, blue eyes.
It has rubbery, balloon-like skin and small, stubby arms and somewhat long feet.
On top of its head is a curled tuft of fur.
As seen in Pok√©mon Stadium, it is filled with air, as a defeated Jigglypuff, deflates until it is flat.
By drawing extra air into its body, it is able to float as demonstrated in Super Smash Bros.

Jigglypuff uses its eyes to mesmerize opponents.
Once it achieves this, it will inflate its lungs and begin to sing a soothing lullaby.
If the opponent resists falling asleep, Jigglypuff will endanger its own life by continuing to sing until it runs out of air.
It is able to adjust the wavelength of its voice to match the brain waves of someone in a deep sleep.
This helps ensure drowsiness in its opponents.
Jigglypuff can mostly be found in lush green plains and grassy meadows.

It hugely inflates its stomach and sings a mysterious melody. If you hear this melody, you'll become sleepy right away.
Jigglypuff possess a vocal range that exceeds 12 octaves, but each individual's singing skill depends on its own effort.
