Kingler is a crustacean Pok√©mon resembling a crab.
Its strong shell covers the outside of its body, featuring a red upper-half, and a light tan lower-half.
Its upper half is topped with six tall, thin spikes that resemble a crown.
Its lower half doubles as its jaw with six fangs overlapping its upper body.
Its two outer fangs are much larger than the inner two, and are roughly half as tall as Kingler's entire body.
Its hips are visibly protruding from its lower body connecting its long, thin legs with claw-like feet.
Kingler's main feature is its red claws.
Its left claw is roughly twice as large as the other and hard as steel.

Kingler is often found on the edges of water, usually the ocean.
It has been observed using its powerful claws to pry open the shells of Shellder and Cloyster.
While Kingler's large, left claw is it main tool for offensive maneuvers, it is so large and heavy that Kingler can barely lift it.
It causes balancing problems and Kingler may quickly become fatigued from continuous use.
However, it has been shown to communicate with other Kingler by waving its pincers around.

The large and hard pincer has 10,000-horsepower strength.
However, being so big, it is unwieldy to move.
Its pincers grow particularly large.
If it lifts the pincers too fast, it loses its balance and staggers.
