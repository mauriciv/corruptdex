Nidoran♀ is a small, quadruped, rodent-like Pokémon.
It has large, spiny ears, oversized front teeth, red eyes, and a pair of whiskers on each cheek.
It is light blue with several darker blue spots.
There are two white claws on each of its paws.
Its back is covered with small toxic spines, and it has a small forehead horn.
The poison secreted by the spines and horn is extremely potent, and even a scratch from its horn or a drop of poison from its barbs can be deadly.
However, this docile Pokémon only uses its poison when it feels threatened.
Nidoran♀ lives in open spaces, such as savannas and plains.
Nidoran♀ is an exclusively female Pokémon, Nidoran♂ being its male counterpart.

Although small, its venomous barbs render this Pokémon dangerous. The female has smaller horns.
Small and very docile, it protects itself with its small, poisonous horn when attacked.
