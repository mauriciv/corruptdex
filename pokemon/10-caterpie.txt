Caterpie is a Pokémon that resembles a green caterpillar.
There are yellow ring-shaped markings down the sides of its body, which resemble its large yellow eyes.
Its most notable characteristic is the bright red antenna (osmeterium) on its head, which releases a stench to repel predators.
This structure and the large eye-shaped markings help to startle predators.
Its feet are tipped with suction cups, permitting this Pokémon to scale most surfaces with minimal effort.

Caterpie will shed its skin many times before finally cocooning itself in thick silk.
It can also spit this silk in order to entangle foes as seen in the anime.
Its primary diet is vegetation, and its voracious appetite causes it to eat leaves larger than itself.
According to Pokémon Adventures, its favorite food is the Vermilion flower.
Caterpie lives in forests.

When attacked by bird Pokémon, it resists by releasing a terrifically strong odor from its antennae, but it often becomes their prey.
It's easy to catch, and it grows quickly, making it one of the top recommendations for novice Pokémon Trainers.
