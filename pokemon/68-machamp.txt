Machamp is a large, humanoid Pokémon with four well-muscled arms.
Its skin is bluish gray, and it has red eyes and pale yellow lips.
On its head, there are three, brown ridges right above its eyes.
It has two arms on each side of its body: a pair located in the normal position, and another pair directly above that attaches on the top of the shoulders.
It has black markings that resemble briefs along with a golden power-save belt.
Its legs have considerable muscle tone, and its feet have two toes.

Machamp punches extremely fast, throwing five hundred punches a second.
With only one hand, it can move a mountain.
Because of its four arms, it can hit from a multitude of angles and pin all of its foe's limbs at once.
However, it has poor dexterity, and cannot handle delicate work without its arms becoming tangled.
It is a rash Pokémon that rushes into action without forethought.
Machamp can be found living in the mountains.

It unleashes megaton-level punches that send opponents flying clear over the horizon.
It can lift heavy loads with the greatest of ease.
It can even heft dump trucks. But its clumsy fingers prevent it from doing any precision work.
