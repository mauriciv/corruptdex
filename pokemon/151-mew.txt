Mew is a pink, bipedal Pokémon with mammalian features.
Its snout is short and wide, and it has triangular ears and large, blue eyes.
It has short arms with three-fingered paws, large hind legs and feet with oval markings on the soles, and a long, thin tail ending in an ovoid tip.
Its fur is so fine and thin, it can only be seen under a microscope.
Mew is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within its body, and as such is able to learn any attack.

As demonstrated by its behavior in the first and eighth Pokémon movies, it shows signs of intelligence, curiosity, playfulness, and even selflessness.
Mew is incredibly adaptable, able to travel freely in the air or underwater.
As seen in Pokémon Snap, it can create a green/yellow/pink orb of energy around itself for protection.

Reports found in Cinnabar Island's Pokémon Mansion note scientific expeditions that have sighted Mew in Guyana, South America, the place where it was first discovered.
Since Mew can make itself invisible at will, very few people have knowingly seen it, leading some scientists to declare it extinct and most to assume it to be a mirage.
It will only show itself to a person who is pure of heart.

Mew is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Genesis Supernova.

Because it can use all kinds of moves, many scientists believe Mew to be the ancestor of Pokémon.
Its DNA is said to contain the genetic codes of all Pokémon, so it can use all kinds of techniques.
Mew is said to possess the genetic composition of all Pokémon.
It is capable of making itself invisible at will, so it entirely avoids notice even if it approaches people.
