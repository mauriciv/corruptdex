Primeape is a bipedal Pokémon with a round body covered in whitish, shaggy fur.
It usually has a throbbing vein on the left side of its forehead, and it has triangular ears with pink insides and a pink, snout-like nose.
Its arms and legs are brown and have metal shackles on the wrists and ankles.
This is probably indicative of a method of training with weights.
The hands have no visible fingers, instead resembling mittens or boxing gloves, and the feet have two toes.

Primeape is easily angered; even the slightest glance of eye contact will make it furious.
When Primeape is furious, its blood circulation is boosted.
This makes its muscles stronger, but at the cost of some of its intelligence.
It will chase anyone who upsets it and will not stop until it has caught its quarry.
Even if it is awoken from sleep, it will groggily chase whatever woke it.
Primeape can be found in vibrant forests or on mountains.
It has shown some fondness for bananas.

It has been known to become so angry that it dies as a result. Its face looks peaceful in death, however.
Some researchers theorize that Primeape remains angry even when inside a Poké Ball.
