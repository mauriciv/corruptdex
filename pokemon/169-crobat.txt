Crobat is a purple, bat-like Pokémon.
This Pokémon's pointed ears are long, and appear to lack insides, while its mouth is small and usually has its teeth bared.
Crobat's eyes are red with yellow scelera.
It has two pairs of wings; one smaller pair is located near its stubby feet, and a second pair on its shoulders has greenish-blue undersides and two stubby 'fingers'.
The hind pair of wings developed from legs, and can still function as such.
This allows it to rest by hanging on a tree branch with its rear wings.

If Crobat is flying by fluttering only one pair of wings, it is proof that it has been flying a long distance.
By alternately resting its front and rear wings, it can fly all day without having to stop.
Crobat is a nocturnal Pokémon that is typically found in caves.


It flies so silently through the dark on its four wings that it may not be noticed even when nearby.
Having four wings allows it to fly more quickly and quietly so it can sneak up on prey without its noticing.
If this Pokémon is flying by fluttering only a pair of wings on either the forelegs or hind legs, it's proof that Crobat has been flying a long distance.
It switches the wings it uses if it is tired.
Crobat sneaks up on its intended prey using wings that barely make a sound.
This Pokémon rests by hanging on a tree branch with its rear legs that serve as wings.

Both its legs became wings, and as a result, it can't move well on the ground.
All it can do is crawl around.
Silent and swift in its four-winged flight, it bites down on its prey before they realize what's happening.
In a heartbeat, it drains their blood.
Its fangs are so sharp, if it bites you in the dark and sucks your blood, you won't notice any pain or realize you've been bitten.
It feeds on the blood of living people and Pokémon.
If it can't drink any blood for even a short while, it becomes weak and unable to fly.
