Stantler is a quadruped, caribou-like Pokémon.
It has a tan pelt with a cream-colored belly and a few spots on its back.
Its tail is large, short, and round, and each of its legs ends in a black hoof.
It has a large, brown nose and a pair of pale cream-colored antlers, each with a black orb in the center.
The shape of the antlers and the black orbs causes them to resemble eyes.
Stantler can distort reality and create illusions with its antlers by subtly changing the flow of air around them.
Staring into them creates an odd sensation, as if one is being sucked through them, and one may become so dizzy that it is impossible to stand.

Its strange antlers are very valuable artifacts to Pokémon hunters.
The species was nearly driven to extinction for its beautiful antlers.
Additionally, the round balls found on the fallen antlers can be ground into a powder that aids in sleeping.
Stantler lives in herds in mountainous forests.
As shown in the anime, a baby Stantler that is separated from its herd and frightened will instinctively produce an illusion of a big, stampeding herd to scare away perceived threats.

Staring at its antlers creates an odd sensation as if one were being drawn into their centers.
The curved antlers subtly change the flow of air to create a strange space where reality is distorted.
Stantler's magnificent antlers were traded at high prices as works of art.
As a result, this Pokémon was hunted close to extinction by those who were after the priceless antlers.
