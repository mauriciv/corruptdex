Shuckle is a Pokémon that resembles a small turtle.
Its body is yellow and appears soft.
Until they are in use, Shuckle's limbs appear limp.
It is encased in a very hard red shell that has many holes in it.
The holes in its shell are rimmed with white.
Rather than actively hunting and foraging for food like most other Pokémon, it collects Berries and stores them in its shell.
The Berries inside are liquefied and fermented while they decompose by Shuckle's digestive juices, which it then consumes.
Its digestive juices are also used to dissolve rocks so Shuckle can hide under them.
It can be found in the mountains.

The berries stored in its jar-like shell eventually become a thick, pulpy juice.
It stores Berries inside its shell.
To avoid attacks, it hides beneath rocks and remains completely still.
Shuckle quietly hides itself under rocks, keeping its body concealed inside its hard shell while eating berries it has stored away.
The berries mix with its body fluids to become a juice.
