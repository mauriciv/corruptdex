Bellossom is a primarily green Pokémon with circular blue eyes and red markings on its cheeks.
It has two bright red flowers on its head and green and yellow leaves around its waist that resemble a skirt, all adding to the appearance of a hula dancer.
Bellossom's petals are said to be more beautiful the worse the Gloom it evolved from smelled.
When it rubs the petals on its head together, it creates a pleasing sound.
Bellossom does not possess feet; in the anime, its center-most leaves bent as it was getting ready to spring, suggesting that it uses its leaves as substitutes for feet or legs.
However, the Pokédex does classify it as a biped.

Bellossom is often seen dancing and chanting.
In particular, Bellossom dances when cloudy weather persists, or when the heavy rainfall season ends and it is drawn out by the warm sunlight.
It lives in grassy plains.

Bellossom gather at times and appear to dance.
They say that the dance is a ritual to summon the sun.
When the heavy rainfall season ends, it is drawn out by warm sunlight to dance in the open.
When Bellossom gets exposed to plenty of sunlight, the leaves ringing its body begin to spin around.
This Pokémon's dancing is renowned in the southern lands.
A Bellossom grows flowers more beautifully if it has evolved from a smelly Gloom—the more stinky the better.
At night, this Pokémon closes its petals and goes to sleep.
