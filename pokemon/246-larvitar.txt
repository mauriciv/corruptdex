Larvitar is a small, green reptilian Pokémon with rocky skin.
It has a blunt spike on top of its head, a short, rounded snout, and triangular, black markings below and on the upper corners of its red eyes.
Red scales cover its diamond-shaped belly, and there are several small holes in its body.
Its short arms lack fingers, while its feet have a single toenail each.
It has a tail with a conical center surrounded by a ring of plate-like scales, causing it to resemble a tunnel-boring machine.
Larvitar is born deep underground, far from its parent.
It grows by consuming soil, and will enter its pupal stage upon eating an entire mountain's worth of earth.
Larvitar usually lives in mountains, hills, and caves.

It feeds on soil.
After it has eaten a large mountain, it falls asleep so it can grow.
Born deep underground, it comes above ground and becomes a pupa once it has finished eating the surrounding soil.
Larvitar is born deep under the ground.
To come up to the surface, this Pokémon must eat its way through the soil above.
Until it does so, Larvitar cannot see its parents.


Born underground, it eats its way through dirt to the surface, where its parents are.
It doesn't deal well with the bright light it finds there.
Raised on nutrients it finds in the dirt, it eats roughly a mountain's worth of dirt before it becomes a pupa.
