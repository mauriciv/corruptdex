Geodude is a gray boulder Pok√©mon.
It has bulging, rocky eyebrows and trapezoidal, brown eyes.
Its arms are muscular with five-fingered hands.
Geodude uses its arms to climb steadily up steep mountain paths.
Geodude is proud of its sturdy body and will bash against others of its kind in a contest of sorts to prove whose body is harder.
The longer it lives, the more chipped and worn its body becomes.

Geodude can be most often found on mountain trails and fields.
It will sit still in these areas, which is why it is often mistaken for a rock.
It is often stepped on, and will sometimes swing its arms in anger when this occurs.
When Geodude sleeps deeply, it buries itself halfway into the ground.
Once buried, it will not awaken even if someone steps on it.
In the morning, Geodude rolls downhill in search of food.

The Geodude of the Alola region are made from a magnetic rock which grants them the Electric-type.
There are areas on the Alolan Geodude's body that are especially magnetic and attracts iron sand, creating the appearance of black eyebrows and strands of short black hair.
Only the thumb and index fingers on the Geodude's hands are free while the other fingers have fused together.

Its round body makes it easy to pick up, but it is hard and heavy.
It's dangerous to play with them as if they were snowballs.
There are plenty of them to be found along any road.
A scholar with too much free time once counted a hundred of them along a single route.
Its body is a magnetic stone.
Iron sand attaches firmly to the portions of its body that are particularly magnetic.
If you accidentally step on a Geodude sleeping on the ground, you'll hear a crunching sound and feel a shock ripple through your entire body.
