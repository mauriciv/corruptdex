Remoraid is a light blue, fish-like Pokémon with saucer-like eyes, and a mouth with four pointed teeth.
There are two dark stripes on its back that resembles the barrel of a revolver.
It has a single pelvic fin positioned like a revolver's trigger, two small pectoral fins, and a dorsal fin near its mouth resembling a gun's front sight.
In addition, it has two caudal fins, the bottom of which resembling the butt of a gun and the top resembling the hammer.
All of its fins except for the dorsal fin are white.

Remoraid is well known for its ability to shoot jets of water from the surface with incredible accuracy and distance, often to shoot down flying insect prey out of the air.
It tends to travel by attaching to Mantine's fins or in large groups of its own kind.
When attached to a Mantine, it feeds on whatever the Mantine leaves behind, but will fight alongside it as well.
Remoraid is a sea-dwelling Pokémon, but when evolution draws near, Remoraid travels downstream from rivers.

It has superb accuracy.
The water it shoots out can strike even moving prey from more than 300 feet.
Using its dorsal fin as a suction pad, it clings to a Mantine's underside to scavenge for leftovers.
Remoraid sucks in water, then expels it at high velocity using its abdominal muscles to shoot down flying prey.
When evolution draws near, this Pokémon travels downstream from rivers.

This Pokémon clings to Mantine and shares in its prosperity.
When its Mantine is attacked, Remoraid will fight alongside it.
Also known as the “sniper of the seas,” its water gun can hit prey without fail from over 300 feet away.
