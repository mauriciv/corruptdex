Abra can sense danger by reading minds.
When it does, it teleports itself to a safe location so quickly that it creates the illusion of having made copies of itself.
By hypnotizing itself, Abra is able to teleport or use any of its other extrasensory abilities at any time.

If it fails to rest long enough, it will become unable to use its powers.
