Drowzee is a bipedal Pokémon that resembles a tapir.
It has tired-looking eyes, a short trunk above its mouth, and triangular ears.
The upper half of Drowzee's body is yellow and the lower half is brown.
A wavy line separates the two halves.
It has a round belly and short legs.
Its feet are brown, except for its two toes, which are the same yellow as the upper half of the body.
The bottom of each foot has a small, round, pink pad in the middle of it.
There are three fingers on each of its hands.

Drowzee is able to put people to sleep, and can then sense the person's dreams.
This is so it knows what kind of dream it would be eating.
It eats dreams through the victim's nose, so it is said that Drowzee is standing over a person's pillow if their nose itches while they are asleep.
Drowzee has certain preferences for the dreams it eats, and it is known to love fun dreams and become ill from bad dreams.
It will rarely eat the dreams of adults, as the dreams of children are seemingly tastier.
Drowzee remembers every dream it has eaten, and may show past meals to a person that often sleeps by it.
Drowzee lives in grasslands and savannas.

A Pokémon that nourishes itself by eating dreams, it is thought to share common ancestry with Munna and Musharna.
It finds really fun dreams tasty.
When it makes friends with people, it may show them the most delicious dreams it's ever eaten.
