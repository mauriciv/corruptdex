Snorlax is a huge, bipedal, dark blue-green Pokémon with a cream-colored face, belly, and feet.
Its body is composed of mostly its belly, where most of its fat reserves accumulate.
Its head is large, with small, pointed ears and two pointed teeth protruding from its lower jaw.
It has large, hind feet with three claws and a circular brown paw pad, and its arms and five foreclaws are short.

Snorlax is often found in mountains and forests.
It wakes up only to eat and seldom for exercises.
It is not a picky eater, as its strong stomach allows it to eat even moldy food without feeling any ill effects.
When hungry, it is not satisfied until it consumes 400 kg of food.
Snorlax is docile enough to let children and small Pokémon bounce on its large stomach.

Snorlax is the only known Pokémon capable of using the exclusive Z-Move Pulverizing Pancake.


Its stomach is said to be incomparably strong.
Even Muk's poison is nothing more than a hint of spice on Snorlax's tongue.
It eats nearly 900 pounds of food every day.
It starts nodding off while eating—and continues to eat even while it's asleep.
It doesn't do anything other than eat and sleep.
When prompted to make a serious effort, though, it apparently displays awesome power.
It has no interest in anything other than eating.
Even if you climb up on its stomach while it's napping, it doesn't seem to mind at all.
