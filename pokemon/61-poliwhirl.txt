Poliwhirl is a blue, bipedal Pokémon with a spherical body.
It has bulbous eyes that protrude from the top of its head.
A black and white swirl covers its belly, which are actually its organs showing through its thin skin.
It appears to have white gloves on its hands and rounded, digit-less feet.

While Poliwhirl is capable of moving on land, it prefers to stay in freshwater ponds and lakes.
When out of water, it sweats to keep its skin moist.
It is always covered in an oily fluid that allows it to slip away from enemies.
All of its skin feels this way except where its swirl is, which is very smooth.
The swirl on its belly undulates slowly, and staring at it induces drowsiness.

Although it can live on land, it prefers to stay in the water, where it has fewer natural enemies.
It marches over the land in search of bug Pokémon to eat.
Then it takes them underwater so it can dine on them where it's safe.
