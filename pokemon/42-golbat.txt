Golbat is a large, blue bat-like Pokémon with purple wing membranes.
It has small eyes with slit pupils and a massive mouth containing four fangs; females have smaller fangs than males.
These fangs are sharp enough to pierce thick hide, and have hollow tubes specialized for sucking blood; however, they are also fragile.
While its mouth seems to be otherwise empty, Golbat occasionally displays a long, purple tongue.
Its pointed ears are tiny, and it has short legs with long, thin feet.

It feeds on the blood of both Pokémon and humans, and is capable of drinking over 10 ounces (300 mL) of blood in one sitting.
Golbat drinks so much blood that its blood type will change to that of its victim following a feed.
It is also gluttonous, occasionally gorging itself to the extent that it becomes too heavy to fly, leaving itself vulnerable in turn.
Golbat is nocturnal, and can be found quite easily in caves.

Its thick fangs are hollow like straws, making them unexpectedly fragile.
These fangs are specialized for sucking blood.
Sometimes they drink so much blood, they can't fly anymore.
Then they fall to the ground and become food for other Pokémon.
