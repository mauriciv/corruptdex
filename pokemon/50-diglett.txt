Diglett is a tiny, brown Pokémon that seems to be perpetually buried within the earth, leaving only its head visible.
Its small stature makes it both the lightest and shortest Ground-type Pokémon.
It has beady black eyes and a large, round, pink nose.
A Diglett in Pokémon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team and Blue Rescue Team mentions that it has feet, though their size and appearance are unknown.
It spends much of its time underground, and has very thin skin.
If Diglett is exposed to sunlight, its blood will heat up and cause it to grow weak.

Diglett digs regularly through the earth at a shallow depth, leaving perfectly tilled soil in its wake.
Diglett lives in tunnels and caves under the earth, where it feeds on tree roots.
It also sometimes lives in burrows near forests, and has even been shown to live inside of trees.
For a brief time, Fissure was its signature move.

Due to volcanic activity of the Alola region, the Diglett there developed fine gold hairs on its head for protection.
Diglett is able to move these hairs to communicate their feelings to others without having to stick their heads out of the ground.

It chews on plant roots underground. Farmers whose vegetables are vulnerable find it can be quite a pest.
Many farmers cherish and nurture Diglett because its droppings enrich the soil it lives in.
Its head sports an altered form of whiskers made of metal.
When in communication with its comrades, its whiskers wobble to and fro.
Its golden hairs function as sensors. It pokes them out of its burrow to monitor its surroundings.
