Aipom is a monkey-like Pokémon with a three-fingered hand at the end of its tail.
Its fur is purple, while the skin of its face, inner ears, belly, feet, and the tip of its tail is beige.
On its face are a usually cheeky smile and round, blue eyes.
Supplemented by its round ears, Aipom's head is disproportionately large compared to its body.
Atop its head is a cowlick that is longer on females than males.
Unlike its feet, Aipom's arms are simple, purple stubs.

Aipom uses its powerful tail freely and cleverly for many purposes.
The tail is strong enough to anchor Aipom to a branch and suspend the rest of its body in the air, but also delicate enough to pick fruit and manipulate objects.
Aipom has been known to wrap its tail around tree branches as it sleeps so it does not fall.
Since Aipom uses its tail so much, its actual arms are not as dexterous and become clumsy over time.
Aipom lives high in the treetops, using its tail for balance as it swings from branch to branch.
In Alola, Bounsweet is its favorite food.

It lives atop tall trees.
When leaping from branch to branch, it deftly uses its tail for balance.
Its tail is so powerful that it can use it to grab a tree branch and hold itself up in the air.
Aipom's tail ends in a hand-like appendage that can be cleverly manipulated.
However, because the Pokémon uses its tail so much, its real hands have become rather clumsy.


As it did more and more with its tail, its hands became clumsy.
It makes its nest high in the treetops.
It searches for prey from the tops of trees.
When it spots its favorite food, Bounsweet, Aipom gets excited and pounces.
