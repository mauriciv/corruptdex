Golduck is a blue, bipedal, duck-like Pokémon.
It has red eyes, a cream-colored beak, and four spikes on the back of its head.
There is a small, red gem on its forehead.
It has webbed hands and feet, which it uses to swim in rivers and lakes.
Its body is especially adapted to have a hydrodynamic shape, and it has a long tail that it uses as a rudder to steer.

Golduck is a fast swimmer, out-swimming even the most athletic of humans because of its webbed hands and feet.
Even rough seas do not hamper this Pokémon’s swimming abilities, and it will sometimes rescue people from shipwrecks.
The gem on its forehead glows when it uses its psychic powers, and occasionally when it swims at full speed.
As shown in the manga, it has the ability to give knowledge to its Trainer and fellow Pokémon through telepathy.

It is said that the red part of its forehead grants supernatural powers to those who possess one, so it was over-hunted in the past.
It swims along the banks of lakes and catches fish Pokémon.
It takes them to the shore and quietly eats them up.
