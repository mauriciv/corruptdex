Piloswine is a big, brown, furry Pokémon with an impressive hump on its back.
It also has two tusks made of ice, which seem small but can be lethal.
These tusks thicken when it snows, and they are smaller on a female Piloswine than on a male.
It has floppy ears that are sensitive to sound.
Piloswine has two beady eyes in its head; however, these are usually covered up by tufts of fur.
As it is usually unable to see, it checks surroundings with its sensitive pig-like nose instead.
Its hair is so long that it usually covers its small, hoofed legs.
Despite the small size of its legs, its hooves ensure even footing on icy ground.
Piloswine tend to inhabit cold places, such as icy caves, mountainous regions and frozen tundra.
It often digs for food buried beneath snow and ice.

Although its legs are short, its rugged hooves prevent it from slipping, even on icy ground.
Because the long hair all over its body obscures its sight, it just keeps charging repeatedly.
Piloswine is covered by a thick coat of long hair that enables it to endure the freezing cold.
This Pokémon uses its tusks to dig up food that has been buried under ice.
