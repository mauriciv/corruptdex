Dewgong is a pinniped Pok√©mon resembling a sea lion.
It has a snowy white, furry body, which renders it virtually invisible in snowy conditions.
Its face has two black eyes with no visible sclerae, a black button nose and two tusks extending from its upper jaw.
It has a streamlined body with two front flippers and a long flowing tail.
Even in extremely cold and ice-packed waters, its tail allows it to be a swift and agile swimmer at speeds of 8 knots.
On top of its head is a sharp horn, which allows it to cut and plow through even the thickest of ice floes.

It lives on icebergs adrift in frigid ocean waters.
It thrives in lower temperatures, becoming increasingly more active the colder the weather gets.
By storing thermal energy within its body, it is completely unharmed by even the most intense freezing weather.
During daylight hours, it sleeps on bitterly cold ice or under shallow water.
However, at night when the temperature drops, it becomes a hunter and searches for prey.

Its body is covered with a pure white fur.
The colder the weather, the more active it becomes.
Its streamlined body has little drag in water.
The colder the temperature, the friskier it gets.
