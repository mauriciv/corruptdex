Politoed is a green, bipedal, frog-like Pokémon with yellow hands, belly, throat, and toes.
It has a long, curled hair on top of its head and pink cheek spots that are smaller on the female than on the male.
There is a green swirl on its belly.
Its legs are well developed and it has bulbous toes and fingers.

Politoed acts as a leader to Poliwag and Poliwhirl, which gather from afar upon hearing its cry.
Politoed likes to expand its throat and sing.
When three or more assemble, they sing in a chorus with a loud, bellowing voice.
The curled hair on Politoed's head is considered proof of its status as a king.
The longer and curlier Politoed's hair is, the more Poliwag and Poliwhirl will obey it, and the more it is respected by other Politoed.
Politoed lives by the water's edge.

Whenever three or more of these get together, they sing in a loud voice that sounds like bellowing.
If Poliwag and Poliwhirl hear its echoing cry, they respond by gathering from far and wide.
The curled hair on Politoed's head is proof of its status as a king.
It is said that the longer and more curled the hair, the more respect this Pokémon earns from its peers.

They gather on moonlit nights to form a large chorus.
Their cries sound angry and not at all pleasant, but they are certainly distinctive.
It's the leader of Poliwag and Poliwhirl.
When Politoed roars, they all cower in fear.
Although its cries sound like screams, a composer created a beautiful ballad that was influenced by the sounds.
The longer and more luxurious the curled hair on its head, the greater the number of Poliwag and Poliwhirl that will obey it.
