Octillery is a red, cephalopod-like Pokémon with large, round eyes and a turret-like mouth.
There are yellow bumps on its rock-hard head and yellow suction cups on each of its eight tentacles.
These suction cups and yellow bumps are smaller on a female Octillery.
It uses its tentacles for manipulating objects and the suction cups give it strong gripping power.
Because of this, it is very hard for it to be blown away.
Octillery is the only known Pokémon that learns Octazooka naturally.

Octillery is a relaxed Pokémon who loves fuss from its Trainer.
In the wild, it will spurt ink containing substances that dull predators' sense of smell to protect its young from danger.
Even though it is more docile when domesticated, it can be very stubborn at times in the wild.
It instinctively sneaks into rocky holes, and if it gets sleepy, it steals the nest of a fellow Octillery.
It sometimes sprays ink on prey by sticking out only its mouth, and its suction cups hold prey tightly.
Octillery is normally found in oceans.

It is also thought to be a distant relative to Omastar.

It has a tendency to want to be in holes.
It prefers rock crags or pots and sprays ink from them before attacking.
It traps foes with the suction cups on its tentacles, then smashes them with its rock-hard head.
Octillery grabs onto its foe using its tentacles.
This Pokémon tries to immobilize it before delivering the finishing blow.
If the foe turns out to be too strong, Octillery spews ink to escape.


The ink it spits when escaping is special.
It contains a substance that dulls the sense of smell, so Pokémon with keen noses get lost.
It usually sleeps in caves.
The pitch-black ink that Octillery spits is also used for cooking.
